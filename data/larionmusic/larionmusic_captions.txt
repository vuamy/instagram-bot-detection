First pic: Manifest caught me in the moment when I began seeping into everything, a feeling that I can only describe as a cosmic hug from within and out. 
Today the ESC boys spent the day fasting from all foods, toxins, chemicals and sugars in preparation and tribute to the Most High during our show tomorrow  @brooklyn.art.cave (7pm) 

Second pic: It is a truly awesome moment when in the resonance of Forest Hills, the prophecy was revealed that @escnyc23  came together to not only fulfill our dreams. But bigger, to prepare people to have faith in their own dreams. As beacons of light. That is why we came together and coined our performances “Playing for Peace” 

Join us then tomorrow and remember your intergalactic roots. -Larion
After 8 months of formation and structured street performance (busking) on May 3rd  ESCNYC’s is having its first 
event at the Brooklyn Art Cave @7pm 

There, We are conducting a conglomerative union of Master Musicians in our efforts to “Play for Peace” in artistic approach to activism, known as “Artivism”

That day we are joined by world musics and international instruments from all communities. 
Here’s a sound bite from yesterdays rehearsal. 

Join us then.
“You have seen me stumble, now watch me rise like the Sun” -Rumi
Surreal momentum after momentum in this experience. 
Thank you for the love. @escnyc23 is going on European tour at the end of the year. Till then catch our show on the 3rd at @brooklyn.art.cave
There’s beauty in being able to laugh at your own mistakes and then continue playing. This post is dedicated to those that have been hard on themself lately. 
 
Whether it’s in front of Three Hundred strangers or in your bedroom. 

follow my simple AAA formula: 
Acknowledge, Account and Accept/ Acclimate. 
Then carry tf on lol 😂

Since playing with @escnyc23 I’ve gotten a whole new love and appreciation for playing the drums & rhythm all together. Thank you @nate.hambrick for inspiring me all the time with your nasty drumming and to @tainovision for capturing this shot of me putting my shoulder in it lol

Peace and Goodwill, upon all on this Spring Equinox New Year season. May we usher in a transcendence of our amassed knowledge into formidable change in a practical way. Becoming and remembering that which we Truly are in essence, embodying authentically the kindness and compassion for our fellow men and women of all faiths, castes, ages and intelligences. 
Let us come together.

In a world of carbon copies and consumerism, may we set our compasses upon the essence of True Revolution, Radical Authenticity.

Yesterday 3/8/24, 

@escnyc23 was ablaze with resonance of Peace 🕊
As we touched 6k+ souls in 7 hours with @escnyc23 
Our feet were firmly planted on the ground while our heads were drunk with the luminescence, and our hearts were rooted. In a world built upon ignorance, hurt and lies, the True act of revolt and decolonization takes the form of authenticity, creation and the infinite power of Love. 

In frame are:

Chilling with the first musicians on earth, yesterday was the highlight of @escnyc23 ‘s 7 hour set at Washington Square park. 

To say the least I love birds, their wisdom and songs are what I listen to when stepping outside. Needless to say, we are outside Playing for Peace. 
Universal resonance is acknowledged and recognized by all life forms.

Thanks, ALL praises To the Most high

We are all creators, some people create music, some people create companies, others create problems. 

We are made in the image of the ultimate creator, society has simply led us astray into forgetfulness.  That is why it is up-to each of us to remember, embody, and reignite. 

For one may light a thousand candles, using the flame of only one candle 🕯

That has always been my purpose and the power of my presence is to be a force of good unto this world. 
To transmute and transmogrify.

Episode 3
A New Earth Town has been created by rising from the shadows of water 

The earth is a being that as a whole being is going through the same thing as the people and dimensions on this earth 

We think we are the only ones present in reality there are many higher dimensional reality shifts occurring on this planet, this causes the earth to change and literally reveal parts of itself that have been dormant. As we evolve thus occurs her evolution.
Such a majestic guy 🥜 is 🐶❤️
Welcome to the 8 year of the wooded dragon
2023 has been a year of transcendental experiences. 
From releasing my first professionally recorded song, to co-creating a top tier music collective ( @escnyc23 ) to getting rocked by my shadow & then surrendering to the Light.  To buying an acre of land & rebuking the conditions of establishment. To going back to school to  become a professional hypnosis practitioner and beginning to write a book on quantum mechanics, physiology & kinesiology. My interests have expanded beyond what I knew in 22’ and so has my influence through compassion. It has been an interesting experience. 

The theme of personal power has been present through out every interaction and experience (whether I was open to them or not) from the depths of agony to the heights of bliss.  I am grateful in humility for the events my awareness has chosen to take me on, in every stage of the arc of Larion’s experience. 

The direction is forward and I trust that you will exercise this child like wonder in all your dealings as well. 

To complete this post I would like to share a heartfelt thank you to this community that has supported and shown love 

Here is a sneak peak of the music video of my single ‘Bird in the Wind’ (video directed by @hulktivision & song produced by @whynotshowlove )
Don’t get stuck in the illusion of life.  it is a dream and illusion. Reality is where you go when you die and when you sleep. That place where all is possible and where you true self is.  What you are now is a fingernail compared to what you truly are

Follow your passions and fulfillment. 
politely yet firmly request of your Higher Self, to reveal the codes and timelines.

In 2024, I am directly showing you from my point of view what it’s like to embody that.

I have learnt a lesson:

When we focus on refinement, we reach a point in which we are able to become aware of how to make things more efficient. When I focus on something it manifests because I’m feeding that thought by giving it a terrain ( a platform) where to thrive. 

A good example is a dresser. Last week I spent 2 moments incrimenting 20 seconds total. (10 each) on the dresser in my room.  Which has served me for 10+ years. I said, it’ll come in Divine time.. that same day. A few hours later. Someone I know gifted me one. I invested an hour in physically building half of this thing. TODAY. 

Building this dresser today reminds me in how what we think about and what allow to be, will be. 24 years and 3 months have lead me to that remember. . We’re manifesting,

thoughts & words are cheap, Energy however doesn’t lie. @halesthephotographer captured the moment in time when @nate.hambrick & I opened up an energetic portal to Christ/ Buddha Consciousness through both our instruments & bodies with the intention of creating a space in time for healing & creation to occur. 

were doing it again tomorrow in Columbus Circle 2-7pm, All are welcome, some will come and transcend. 

Check out the Auras 🌅
The beauty of performance is the inspiration that is unlocked within those that are present in the moment. Here are two separate pieces of art that were inspired by @escnyc23 on multiple occasions of us channeling vibrations 🎸

On Tuesday a collective of 7 Ascended Masters came together to create a masterpiece band by the name of Turquoise Pyramid, to shine light upon the world with our powerful music & message: Liberation.

This video is for a collaborative series called “The Church of Chill”  with our friends @seanveryape & @greenerdaze of @veryapetv. 

 We will be touring the world (Old & New) in 2024, soon
Rejoice in the Light and know that your honest & authentic expression, inspires and engulfs others to do the same. We played to 400+ people yesterday in the park, people of all ages danced, people on crutches move and jive, and children smile. THATS the purpose of creating, not for the money, fame, or any other boons (all those things come inevitably) but for the purpose of inspiring and expanding others.

Can you guess our favorite cheese? 🧀 

Should we release this one? 
With @bigfaart @dj_jazzyjohn
"🌞 What an enchanting evening it was, as I had the pleasure of premiering my song "Bird in the Wind" alongside my band, the (fabled) Larion & The Larionetts, at the delightful @urbanveganroots this Wednesday. 🎶

Amidst the illustrious legends gracing the walls of this community stage/restaurant, I felt a profound sense of belonging. The atmosphere brimmed with laughter, joy, and the sweet resonance of music, a clear sign that our vibrations were ascending and we were living our life's true purpose.

As we prepared to bid farewell to dear friends embarking on their journey to Berlin this year, the enchanting magic of @_2.feathers_ grounded us, while the captivating melodies of @beth.bliss & @teej.music solidified the vibe with their original tunes. Later, @djrickmanholla took us on a musical odyssey akin to a tranquil LSD trip in the park.

And for the grand finale, the Show Love Band illuminated every nook and cranny of Astoria within a 3-mile radius of @urbanveganroots. 🌟

I extend heartfelt gratitude to our masterful musicians of the evening:

Steal my secret to music here (SoundCloud link in Linktree)
We must hold those in the government that are elected and took an oath to serve the people of their province. responsible for their gross sedentary behavior and misuse of power. In a way this too serves a purpose because it is clear as day that this system does not work. It is meant to demonstrate the ineffectiveness of the current state of Global and Local Politics, I see more and more people awakening out of the conventional trance state of ignorance and blind faith in; people, ideas, systems and governments.— this is the upside and purpose of All we are witnessing.

From Biden’s inability to speak a cohesive sentence, to the fires in Hawaii, and ufos. It is all there to serve a purpose, that purpose is the Truth shining light on the bullsh*t which we have been programmed from our 1st day here to believe.  Hold those in power (starting with YOU) accountable. ask questions and thinking for yourself. That is the Way.
📍On Wednesday: the Sacred Trio and I came together in the name of Love at to spread Light unto the world in the name of Unity @unionsquareny we we’re greeted eagerly by the multitudes of New York City where we all together, created a cosmic peace that will outlive us all. 

showcasing our original tunes and interactively educating. 
#
‘The New Earth’ is being created & recreated by you and I every second of the day. it is our responsibility to choose which earth we will be a steward of. We must come together in the Name of Love.

when we change our internal state of vibrancy our external experience quickly follows, this is the formula.

A memory worth sharing: that time we pulled 300+ heads with  @whaleinwasp at the @theboweryelectric captured by @dvnielalexander & a new phase and jam open to all artists and musicians/ MCs @phase_222
In the twilight there is a change.
Even in modern times with all the stresses and stimulation. 

Remember your Christ hood/ Buddha nature which  is core of the inner realm, which should dictate your responses in this world. Do not react. Respond.

Use everything that you must to advance your spiritual knowledge, yet always remember that you do not own anything, not  even your own body.

Tuesday. (9/5/23) I will be playing with @dj_jazzyjohn & @nate.hambrick at Union square and spreading love amongst the multitudes. Join us in the flesh to destroy the old way and partake with us in the creation of the new.
Yesterday I had the honor of playing the 3rd annual Queensbridge Vegan Festival hosted & organized by community activist and artist @sugaray4506 
It is there where the Show Love Collective played and brought healing vibration to the community. 

right before my song Bird in the Wind, during a song by @whynotshowlove named “the Lonely Road” I witnessed someone take their life in the distance, from the 59th st bridge. Tho I don’t know the details,  the plummet happened, I didn’t understand why I was meant to see it happen. I have been in meditation since. 

check on one another & hold space for each other. Be kind to family, friends and especially strangers, because even a simple act of kindness is free and can save someone’s life. 

I don’t align with the concept that we are alone and must hustle for xyz the truth could not be farther from that we have one another and more importantly our connection to source. We must be there for one another.

Peep, Bird in the Wind by Larion Ross is the last song
Tbt to our first performance at @chashama where we played Bird in the Wind Live for the very first time in front of an audience. It was a wonderfully affirming  experience in seeing the amount of people who resonated with my song, and the fact that I was able to play it with not just any old band, but a band that Shows Love and care about one another as friends. 

Here’s the Live Version of my song Bird in the Wind

I asked her everyday leading up to it what it would be, tenaciously trying to figure out, until the gem was dropped through Awareness. Surrender❤️

So I did and was pleasantly surprised & grounded. Thank you all for the Birthday wishes and for being your authentic selves, this is the greatest gift one can receive.

Tonight marks the culmination of a year-long journey – a voyage fueled by unwavering dedication, tireless work, and an unshakeable belief in my higher Self. 

For those who may not know, the past 12 months have been dedicated to a special project. A labor of love that involved not just composing and scoring, but also navigating the intricate process of hiring and working closely with seasoned professionals, master musicians, and supportive investors. 

I'm beyond proud and deeply moved to unveil what I believe to be my magnum opus – Bird in the Wind. An original composition penned and composed by yours truly, @larionmusic, with the invaluable assistance from @whynotshowlove in production. 

More than just a milestone in my career, this EP resonates with my personal growth, spiritual ascension, and our collective journey. It is not just my story, but also a testament to our shared human experiences and emotions.

Tonight, I invite you all to share in my joy and celebrate this momentous occasion. Bird in the Wind will be available on all platforms for your listening pleasure on the 13th.  Let's countdown together to this beautiful beginning. 🎵 #BirdInTheWind #DuoEP

Wisdom of the Guitar- 
💎Lesson by Larion Ross 

Episode 1- (Curiosity)
The pre warm up at @american_beatbox in @chashama stay tuned to the next one ;)
Gods nature is Grace, Man’s nature is Compassion. 

Upon the embers that burn 🔥 🏚 the Archaic systems (that profit on the pimping & coercing of the Soul) will rise a world 🌎 whole upon compassion rather than cheap passions. Love and Praise unto the Love Ultimate which is reshaping and evolving our hearts and opening our minds.  May we find inspiration in the realization of our True being.
Yesterdays Kayak & Chill was a success, it was my first time treading the waters in this kind of  vessel, further deepening that love which is ever present in the beauty which the earth has to offer in every single person, place, and being. 

Shout out to the crew that came through, we drove from Queens & BK to the land of the Setalcott of Stonybrook. We are the Answer, Merry ThanksLiving
Don't believe everything you hear
or read Think for yourself. Don't
give your power away to anyone.
Make up your own mind and
Discover your own truth.
Be, the change you want to see in the world. If you don’t see it in the world yet— then you are the fulfillment of that prophecy and must create it. The nature of all human beings at their  CORE, is compassion. 
That’s what I’m here to embody, and that’s what you hear & feel through my hands transmogrified as sound. You are the Antidote. Don’t forget that. 

@drink.antidote  @phase_222 @hulktivision @therealjjuice @tainovision
This week I had the honor of sharing the stage with my brothers and sisters of the ShowLoveBand at the @american_beatbox embassy in the Metropolitan Bus Terminal as the first and only band to ever play in this venue. Here is a clip of our song Throw Away Blues. Performed by @santronbysource @beth.bliss @danielfresco @whynotshowlove @dj_jazzyjohn @teej.music & me ( @larionmusic )  a day of bliss and Divine coordination that left the audience with a memory of Love and exorcized the frustrations of an ever changing world and ignorance of many. words cannot accurately describe the pleasure it is to be a contributing part of this Band of Ascended Masters. 
Simply put for many years, (15 to be exact) I have longed to be a part of a musical collective where the individuals within are 1. Kind hearted. 2. Having integrity. 3. dedicated. & 4. Talented and disgusting on their individual instruments.  after 15 years of playing with many different collectives and groups and seeking that type of chemistry the stars have aligned. 

Our message is simple & genuine, show and give love unto others, and the Love Ultimate will realize it within you. 

I special shout out to the crew of incredible interns present that day & the behind the scenes pros bundy.bundy @realjakerich your love and commitment to the art of creation is appreciated
Peace Tomorrow, We well be

When someone asks me if I have permit for a speaker to play in ANY area in NYC. I got a sharp ass but loving reminder for em.  No one’s “authority”  takes precedence over mine. Because mine is rooted in the essence of the Truth My experience, the I Am.  all opposition will be kindly asked to kiss my Divine 🍑😘
The life of my dreams unfolds effortlessly as I let go of all fears and uncertainties that hinder my divine and genuine expression. I am deeply grateful for all the lessons, challenges, and triumphs along my journey, as they shape me into the empowered and accomplished person I am. I am in deep alignment with my higher self, embracing the wisdom and guidance it provides, and releasing all illusions obstructing my connection to my divine essence. 
Amen.

Vc: @larionmusic
Ask for consent always. Thanks 😉
Today as we are in the clouds of terrestrial change. There are 400+ fires that engulf the lands of Canada 🇨🇦 and worsen the air quality of the metropolises near by. 

In the already delicate balance between Humanity’s duty to protect nature. I cannot help but acknowledge the realization of what we have already known. 

Micro:
That, which one of us goes through, we all go through. 

Macro:
Everything involving other parts of the globe, involve us. As Global citizens. 

I pray that those effected first hand by the element of fire 🔥 this week, are safe and stand grounded with hope. knowing that they exist in a world where they are not alone. They exist in a world where the good of Humanity will persevere over the not so good. 

Friends, let us use this opportunity to foster more kindness between one another, and more importantly between the earth which we are guests on. 

To my friends in the Canadian sector, we love you.

to Gaia 🌎 we see and hear you, changing and acknowledge what you are going through and  what you are becoming, Ultimately. 

We love you and are grateful for everything (literally) from the Air, to the ground that supports our steps and the water that’s we are.

This season I learned the wise lesson of releasing guilt and judgement towards yourself for your sins & vices and what not—from food to tobacco whatever it may be. 

To release yourself from labels that have been out grown, is freedom 🦶🏼like the 👟 shoe of a child. labels are limiting. So are comparisons.
. 
Limiting it to a term profoundly miscommunicates  the Awesomeness of That which is being described here, and looking to be found through vices and such.  Your True nature. 

It is not the drug or the vice, it is Your True Nature you are chasing. It is always present and is eternally with you. It is you.  and irrespective of here and any thing. Lay your shield down 🛡🗡

you are always on Time and in the correct spot in your Soul’s journey, even if your personality disagrees. 

💎, 
The ego is impatient because it is limited, to a body. 
The Soul, however is patient because it’s eternal. 

Amen. 🙏🏼

My path diverged from traditional college routes, leading me to organize interdisciplinary jams, creative workshops, and community events. I developed the skills to direct musical productions, secure sponsorships, network with fellow creatives, and master the intricacies of music composition, licensing, and royalties. 

Many of you may recall my high school years, when I struggled to reconcile my passion for artistic expression with conventional academic expectations. This inner drive ultimately propelled me towards a rewarding and fulfilling career in music.
Let us inspire hope and empower the next generation to pursue their passions, fostering a world where creativity, dreams, and individuality are celebrated.

I am thrilled to announce that I will be performing at the Cardozo Talent Show today 6:00PM It is an honor to share the stage with the incredible talents of our school community and showcase the beauty of creative expression. Through every note I play, I hope to convey the trials, tribulations, and triumphs that come with pursuing our dreams.

I look forward to seeing you all there and celebrating the boundless potential of Creative Expression. -Larion
Returning to the environment where I spent four transformative years of my life feels humbling. It was an honor to be invited to be a speaker at the Annual Cardozo HS. Career Fair. where I had the opportunity to guide and inspire the next generation of creative minds. Last Thursday, I had the pleasure of hosting two incredible creatives, @esaxnegra and @whynotshowlove, for a five-hour session with the youth. Together, we shattered the limiting beliefs ingrained in their hearts by well-meaning but misguided friends and family members. We challenged the notion of the 'starving artist' and expanded their horizons to endless possibilities.

But it wasn't just a one-way street of teaching. I also learned valuable lessons from these bright young minds. It's a beautiful exchange, where we all grow together.

Those who knew me during my high school days remember that I had a complicated relationship with school and its traditional expectations. I refused to be confined by an outdated curriculum that only acknowledged the paths of blue collar and white collar jobs. Instead, I chose to be a trailblazer and master musician, following my inner compass. And you know what? It led me to priceless experiences that many can only dream of. 

Despite the discouragement I received as a child from well-intentioned individuals who saw music as an impractical hobby, I held onto my dreams.
And now, I feel a sense of duty to educate people of all ages. 

We must teach children to pursue their goals fearlessly, to defy the notion of a 'safe' path. That's how we bring about reformation. It's okay to dream big and go after what you love.

I share my story and experiences to remind everyone that dreams are worth pursuing. I encourage you to listen to your inner voice, even when others throw doubt your way. Let's inspire a generation that believes in the power of their dreams."

Exciting news! This Thursday, May 4th, I am honored to be a special guest at the Cardozo Talent Show, the very show that started it all for me in high school. It's an incredible feeling to return and share the stage with 3,000+ attendees, raising the vibration and spreading positivity.
Returning to where it all began feels humbling. Honored to be a speaker at the Cardozo HS Career Fair, guiding and inspiring the next generation. Joined by incredible creatives, @esaxnegra and @whynotshowlove, we shattered limiting beliefs and expanded horizons. Lessons learned from these bright young minds too.

In my high school days, I rejected the traditional expectations, choosing to be a trailblazing musician. Priceless experiences followed. Despite discouragement, I held onto my dreams.

Now, I feel a duty to educate all ages. Let's teach kids to fearlessly pursue their goals, breaking free from the 'safe' path. Reformation is possible. Dream big!

Exciting news! May 4th, I'll be a special guest at the Cardozo Talent Show, where it all started. Join 3,000+ attendees for an evening of talent, inspiration, and nostalgia. Let's celebrate creativity and the courage to pursue dreams. See you there!"

🎸 My Single, 

Bird in the Wind is on the cusp of reaching the financial goal mark for a 🚦Green Light on being recorded and released. Here is a visual that I’d like to offer and share with you which I have in mind for the automated version. (in addition to a behind the scenes look into my creative recording process) 

Now, 
I need your help. If 91 people are moved by this post to donate $2. I can reach my goal and record this song which I’ve been working tirelessly to produce, promote and serve, since June, 2022. 
Thank you. #faith
Friends and family, I am grateful for the consistent; love, affirmation and support which I have received on this fundraising journey. Thank You. 

In December of 2022, I set out on a mission. to pursue and step up my passion . (Within) Music & Creation. 
Spending many hours by the candle light writing and plotting out my vision of Mixing/Mastering & Releasing My New song:
 “Bird In the Wind” 

Once the budget was written, came the REAL work. 
The next 3 months would become a point of humility & surrender. The reception I was met with from the community was astounding. I needed help, so I asked for it.. & I got it. now I’m asking for YOUR help again. 

So far in (private & Gofundme fundraising) we have raised close to 1.8k out of 2k to begin with the production. Leaving a small gap of ONLY $185

We ARE CLOSE

Love thy shadow, it is always ready to protect you and teach you. Run not from your shadow as you would not banish your left eye, for twitching. You have nothing to fear in its presence. For it is a part of Self that must sit at the feast alongside the other facets or Self. 
Walk with your shadow in harmony, acceptance and love. & you will actually find that, the shadow is a pleasant rascal. Your rascal. The sooner you realize this, the sooner you can embody the light. 

For without shadows, light is foreign to the eye & lacks depth.

Om Shanti🕉, 

Make peace with yourself before you can make peace with the world. accept the truth for what it is; that there is no: one truth. Other than that of infinity & Divine. Ineffable in words, yet graced through surrender, stillness. 

Your peace and wholeness will be found there. It is closer than your bones & more you, than your blood itself. 

-Larion🌞🧧
Om Shanti 🕉

May we understand the importance of rest, as a fundamental truth of liberation. 
For even on the 7th day The Most High rested. In a world addicted to production and productivity, rest is the truest form of self empowerment and longevity. 

So, fill your lungs to the brim and release the air back to the source. Rest is your Divine Right just as is Creation. 

-Larion 🌞🧧
Om Shanti 🕉,

Breathe in & Breathe out. 
Surrender your control to the innermost melody of life. That, which is deeper than the body and more ancient than the breath in your lungs. 
Hum a melody. smile at a stranger. Be kind and listen. Love is the only answer. 

In a time of perceived disharmony, you can change the world by being kind, gratuitous and loving to one another. 

If you have a hard time, believing that which is you IS god, surrender & try embodiment. 

-Larion 🌞🧧

Transcend the Physical and recognize the good in the moment, theres alot of chatter going on around. And the worst thing you can do now is join the chorus.

Transcend.

May we be open to Divine intervention within our hearts and lives. May we express gratitude & celebrate the things within our lives that dont work out. Remembering that all that is for us, will be. And all that is not, wont. 

Happy Full Moon & entrance to Spring 
All the best, Larion 🌞🧧
OM Shanti 🕉❤️

Happy Valentines Day, lets drop all the institutionalization aka (bullsjit) and love one another through honesty, intention and accountability this year

(Much like Black History Month, Valentines Day is EVERYDAY) 

Thats all for now xx

Om Shanti 🕉
Nothing in this world is linear 
neither life. nor success. We must thus be present in the nonlinear polars of divinity. Trusting the process of divine timing. We must rise above the duality of win-lose. black-white. Up-down. And always remain centered. 
-Larion🌞🧧
Om Shanti🕉
May we Awaken to our Integrity this season.

Acting from a place of compassion, in union with heart and mind. 
speaking truth & treating the earth with the gratuity and abundance that she so willingly gifts us all, each day.

Guys this year has been bitter sweet for me. 
💮 it has taught me an abundance of wisdom & growth 🚀Through fucking up and just doing the spiritual work man. 
Hoping for big things in December & 2022.  I’m ready to reveal some Secrets. 💋
.
An excerpt from “The Journal of Bliss” 
(a pillar from my @larionlarion1 work) 

“There are moments of bliss and there are moments of immense growth and detachment periods. But that’s because the healing is never truly complete. polarizing and testing the hero each day.  Never the less, conflicts that are encountered cyclically, are handled more efficiently when ran mindfully. Experience is knowledge.“
by Larion. 

My Podcast; Will support and promote MENS Mental Health within OUR community. 
Men’s Mental Health is not often talked about because Men often don’t feel they have someone they can talk TO, without feeling weak.  I’m here to challenge that stigma on a cultural level. Warriors need to communicate their feelings too. 

Keep an eye out 🦃

Painful at first but humbling. 

Announcing somethings soon
DATE UPDATE: J U N E 28th not June 21.

Sorry for any inconvenience 🙏🏾

Happy PRIDE 🏳️‍🌈 

Artists/Creators of New York! Have you been interested in using your art for social change and something bigger than yourself? Then the event my team and I are hosting is for you. 

On June 28, my team and I are having a hands-on Brooklyn-based event at @blankbamboo where we will be working in conjunction with the Traditional African Performing Arts Center (TAPAC-Uganda). To support their mission of teaching young Bamasaba community members how to play and perform traditional African music, dances and theatre, during Africa’s battle with COVID-19. 

The homie Shulamit Passaro @shula.skakes an Associate Somatic Dance Educator and Creative Arts facilitator will be there facilitating powerful hands-on activities to align you with your mind, body, and spirit so you can further connect to not only the others in the room, 
But also the community, your environment, and the world we belong to. 

Followed by an Interactive Jam session where we’ll Vibe together and then Finally enjoy 
Performances by THE @onnionnioxenfree & @adjuamusic 🙏🏾

Its time for us to transcend beyond ourselves, and COLLABORATE rather than compete. To do something for the Greater Good of the world on the 21st 
The place to Upgrade from Artist: to ARTIVIST (Artist+Activist) is here.

So I need your support.

With your contributions or shares 
this Fundraiser will help TAPAC continue to provide essential services to Ugandan youth with housing, food, medicine and education

To keep it real with you. 
This is a painful but transitional moment in my life

The growth frankly, hurts but, I know there is a purpose and there is a place for it. I'm grateful for it. 
Not just because pain and pleasure are subjective (and should be taken as equal in value.)
but because each experience controls the chisel that shapes the stone and helps me love the universe and it's people more. 

Its the tenderness that, leads to gratitude,
The same tenderness that leads to oneness.

Be kind 🌸

"Larion" by Larion Greene

This EP is something special to me and personal on all levels. Because it is a physical manifestation of 10 years worth of my life as a musician.
Even though it's relatively short, the emotion and meaning behind the sound is potent.

"Larion" is the product of overcoming perfectionism, reclaiming personal power, and controlling ego with the glow of honesty and acceptance.
. 
Subtitled: "Intimacy & Sound"

This EP is raw with color and passion as I play to the ecstasy of gold, from breaking down a pedestal that was  created to hold you back.Something many of us struggle with even on our best days. We all want to put our best foot out but never move it forward.
.
🌸This EP is a promise to myself,
To honor my bold spirit, and embrace my individuality, by getting out of my own way and accepting me more.
.
with each day (good and bad) slowly but surely, I am accepting the meditations of life, using the guitar as mediumship and extension. 
.
a bridge between me and Source, here it is.

Truth is I'm not that rocker with long hair and loud guitar solos, anymore. I'm a humble but confident hue to the notes. The instrument speaks through me, fm? So I let it, -me 🙏🏼 accepting THAT is a step towards Moksha

I'm FINALLY free of travel grief because, 

I just had a crazy discovery as to why I loved costa rica and Italy townd so much. Its the vibe and way of life. It was all kind of like life back in 2012/ 2014 when things were simpler and had a particular kind of cool to it, dig? 

It was like being reminded of innocence and cool minds, once again. 

And I didnt want to leave because, well.. that kind of freedom is addictive, and childlike in essence. Something I think we all long for, here and there.
Since freedom leads to a state of balance.

In Sanskrit its called: möksha. 
In  English its described as; release from the cycle of rebirth impelled by the law of karma.

It was the same freedom that I possessed once, and that's showed me that It has more to do with environmental influnces like weather and 
personal effect, 

My own dang self. 

I could make myself feel like that here too,
it's why the summer is so irresistibly good no matter what yk?

Little by little I am taking back this freedom
Little by little, I like myself more.
Just growing pains .
OUT ON THE 6TH 🌸
.
Tech Issues with @distrokid have pushed the EP release back to the 6th. 
Nevertheless I'm really excited to show you a glimpse of my world

On Friday 200 people came out  to crowd surf,
pass a prosthetic leg & overall spread Peace and Love within the Music Community ✌💜. This is exactly what the  communities of not only artists and creatives need, but society and America needs. To keep moving forward and to stand together, and grow as one.

Although I am no longer in  coalition with @whaleinwasp , 
I strongly recommend you keep following their muaic and keep an eye out for their  future shows (See tag below)
