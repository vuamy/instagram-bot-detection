Some pics as Bela Dimitrescu hehe ✩ I love how this session turned out!
♡
Thanks to the amazing @sakurami_photo for yet another amazing work, to @ssickracha for being an amazing support, and to @cafedelashoras for letting us use this stunning location, the vibes were ✨immaculate✨ (shoutout to their pumpkin pie omg 🤧💕)

🎀 ¡Aquí tenéis la actuación de la anterior @japanweekend en Valencia! 🫶🏻
Esperamos que la disfruteis mucho, tanto lxs que no pudisteis venir a vernos en directo como lxs que la volvéis a ver (⁠人⁠*⁠´⁠∀⁠｀⁠)⁠｡⁠*ﾟ⁠+
Estamos muy agradecidas por el apoyo que recibimos, el cual no esperábamos para nada teniendo en cuenta que no es lo típico con lo que se sube a un idol 🥹💕 
¡Y también queremos disculparnos por la calidad! Contábamos con que el evento iba a grabar las actuaciones, pero aún no tenemos nada (⁠╥⁠﹏⁠╥⁠) así que vamos tirando con este video 🤍 si consiguieramos un con más calidad, lo subiremos para que podáis verlo mejor!

🌸 Kotori Minami "A Song for You! You? You!!" ver. 🌸
I love Kotori and cosplaying her always feels like a dream 🤍🫶🏻 Such a comfort character for me ⭐
Full set including full body pics in this version + cheerleader version on my kofi shop ☕🎀
It's been (almost) a week since this last @japanweekend and I'm still emotional (⁠╥⁠﹏⁠╥⁠) 💗 Saying I enjoyed performing is definitely an understatement ｡⁠*ﾟ⁠+ Everytime I go up on a stage I feel like I can do everything, and I don't feel a single bit of fear or anxiety. It just makes sense. I belong there, somehow. Lol. (⁠ ⁠ꈨຶ⁠ ⁠˙̫̮⁠ ⁠ꈨຶ⁠ ⁠)
No but like fr. This is what I enjoy the most. And hearing all of the wotas and the public cheering on me and my group feels amazing. 💕🎀 I hope I can continue being an idol for many more years 💗🫶🏻 I'm just getting started!
Thank you @miaka293 for being as obsessed as me with @japan_leaders, and thank you @hahonotosa and @hikarilore for making our dream come true. I love y'all so much 🥹 @aikuri_idols 💗💗💗 I'm very proud of our perfomance.
I also want to thank @chiharuaoi_ for being a cutie (+best Yor) and spending the day with us 💕 ilysm and I love the ring you gave me (⁠｡⁠ﾉ⁠ω⁠＼⁠｡⁠)
Aaaand last but not least, I want to thank the judges for the award and also congratulate both @rosemaryhoney_idol and @bluemoon_cosplay because they absolutely deserved those awards too 💗 Y'all were incredible!!
Anyways, I think that's enough text for a caption (⁠´⁠-⁠﹏⁠-⁠`⁠；⁠)
Can't wait to create more happy memories on stage. 🌸🎀💗
⭐🤍💕 neko idol, yuna! 🌸🐈☁️
out of cos, since some of you told me you also wanted to see pictures like this (⁠´⁠ ⁠.⁠ ⁠.̫⁠ ⁠.⁠ ⁠`⁠)✩
👻 happy to meet you my buddy buddy! 💜
💗 some pics i took a couple of weeks ago at @saloncomicvalencia 🌸 finally had an opportunity to wear my first ever miku cosplay that i bought back in november 2020, and dance to senbonzakura in it 🌸 i had a blast but i was SO anxious (⁠´⁠-⁠﹏⁠-⁠`⁠；⁠) it was my first time ever dancing on my own with no one else in a big stage, and although i could've done better, i'm proud of how things went down considering i was about to have a heart attack (⁠〒⁠﹏⁠〒⁠) hehe 💕

You guys don't know how much I love this cosplay 🥺🤍 More content to come VERY VERY soon hehehe (⁠人⁠ ⁠•͈⁠ᴗ⁠•͈⁠) I'm really excited about it!!
Btw sorryyy, my dumb ass forgot to wear the gloves while taking pics - at least the nail polish matches (⁠´⁠-⁠﹏⁠-⁠`⁠；⁠)
Kotori debut 🐣 So, I went to a con after like 5 years? I believe last time I went was May 2019 but !!!! I had so much fun yesterday 🩷 I'm so happy about it because this just shows how I'm overcoming my anxiety, even if the steps I take are small. They're steady. And I definitely want to dance on the stage again hehe (⁠ ⁠◜⁠‿⁠◝⁠ ⁠) We'll upload the performance video soon on @aikuri_idols so stay tuned (⁠´⁠ ⁠.⁠ ⁠.̫⁠ ⁠.⁠ ⁠`⁠)
🐰 gg! 💕
Freeze team besties! 🫧❄️🤍 Would you join us?
