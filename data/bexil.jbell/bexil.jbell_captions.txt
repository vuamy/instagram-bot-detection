Some concept work for my final project in my 3d modeling course. (I‚Äôve been wanting to recreate this in 3d for a while now. Hopefully it works out)
Le birthday post, with a mathematical proof by delusion and a few unreleased sketches from the past year. Yet another year has gone by, almost in the blink of an eye, and it‚Äôs been a doozy with post grad life. Now I‚Äôm 23 and a third of the way into my twenties. Still, I wanted to thank all of you who are in touch with me for a wonderful year of hijinks and fun. I hope to do more of everything, from studying CS to drawing.
Here‚Äôs a short animation I made in blender using greasepencil for one of my classes (admittedly it‚Äôs not great because I was using only a mouse for this but I think some of the framing turned out decent)
Clown lion. Nuff said (painting + og sketch)
Happy (early) valentines day y‚Äôall! I was studying for midterms and was inspired to make ‚Äúa-dork-able‚Äù valentines cards based on matrix decompositions (PLU and QR decomposition, general eigendecomposition, and singular value decomposition (SVD)). Great for rizzing up math students or ensuring that you stay single!
Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays to y‚Äôall! (three variants)
More experimental composition work to stave off the midterm brain rot.
Taking a jab at painting/scene rendering with orange grumpy cat boi (could I have used Dalle2? Probably. Am I going to? No. Might this end up in someones training dataset? Who knows?)
Presenting The Amazing Digital Circus (fanart)! It ain‚Äôt super Halloweeny or anything but then again, isn‚Äôt being trapped in a digital world with no escape spooky enough?
Some summer sketches w/ emphasis on anatomy and character design
Hopping on the trend w/ the purple McDonald‚Äôs shake. Drink responsibly y‚Äôall.
With Tears of the Kingdom being out, we‚Äôre letting Lynel Link loose onto the rolling plains of Hyrule! 
(Ngl, I‚Äôve been playing ToTK almost nonstop, I really just had to make some fanart for this game cuz I love it too much)
A sketch commemorating 22 years of existing, a devil of a person ready to gaslight, gatekeep, girlboss, and f**k sh*t up within the year to come.
To all my pals who have or who are graduating from uni or cooleg, congratulations!! Y‚Äôall have worked real hard to get here and I‚Äôm proud that we are gonna get that acknowledgement wearing a weird square hat and getting that special piece of paper that is the diploma.
My first animated anything! I was inspired to try it out after seeing @watsonswaddles lovely animated work, ‚ÄúHarmless Creatures‚Äù. (Granted, this pales in comparison to that amazing work effort wise. Watswaddles, if you‚Äôre seeing this, massive props to ya!)
A quick sketch I did today. Loosely by medieval animal art and Vashti Bunyan‚Äôs music (especially ‚ÄúSame but Different‚Äù)
Happy Halloween! Here‚Äôs some spooky/creepy doodles from my sketchbook (plus one or two for sh*ts and giggles)
(Warning: this is gonna be LONG) 
It‚Äôs been a while since I last posted anything here, and an even longer while to get to this point. My 21st b-day is coming up soon, but the journey to get here has been anything but easy, especially within the past couple years. As such, I wanted to draw something that represents my journey to getting here; It is a journey that began with self discovery amidst the pressures to conform with given values. This was followed by a downward spiral into low self esteem and personal pressures which evolved into self loathing, isolation and, exasperated by the pandemic, mental illness. In truth, the journey could have ended there, but through the support of others and eventually myself, I was able to break free from my hellish chamber of negative thoughts and find self acceptance and a better sense of my own worth. In some sense, this journey is not over and I am still not in the clear. After all, my life will continue to change drastically within the coming years and I will need to figure out how to adapt to it given my strengths and weaknesses. Likewise, there‚Äôs a chance that I may fall back into the darkness. Despite this, I hope I can continue to develop as a person, be true to myself, make new connections, and, most importantly, be the best person I can be to myself and others. I thank all of you who have supported me and have been by my side at some point in my life. I could not have gotten here without you guys. With that, I hope to post more art (and maybe even mental health/neurodivergency support stuff) soon.

Sincerely,
Arisa, 
AKA: Bexley, Reese
