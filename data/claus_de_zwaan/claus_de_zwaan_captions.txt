Vanmiddag in @duindorpschoorl tegenover het bezoekerscentrum waar het stukje hei bijna aan het verdrinken is en de berken het lijken te gaan over nemen. Samen met @bodezwaan nog even het laatste beetje zon kunnen mee pikken
Hail in April after a sunny day with almost 18 °C yesterday..
Lovely (bit rainey) walk in the Westerwald hills
Happy Solstice everyone!🐰🐥💐🌼🏵️🌸☀️
Love our cats, sometimes I wish I could enjoy life like that: just be . But one snif of their food and I'm cured🤭
Seeking shelter, or is our cat trying to visualize  Imbolc, the awakening of Nature in the last stages of winter?

Strange to think this used to be a seashore.. This afternoon I finally enjoyed some proper winter sun along the shore of wat used to be the 'Zuiderzee' (South Sea) known for a lot of disasters because of its shallow  waters and many storms. Now this part is called Markermeer and there were plans to make it yet another 'polder' (gaining land by pumping out the water), which thank Goddess didn't happen. It was a cold, windy, but nevertheless pleasant walk.
High and low (er) water on the brook leading to the Nister just one day in between

Very near the highest dunes of Schoorl, had a lovely walk with you know who🤭😊🥾🥾

'Harvest' of today😊 Happy Mabon everyone! 
(I know it is not exactly Mabon, but hey to me it feels this way, so enjoy your inner calendar!) ❤️✨

As advised by @aardewerkt 😊, we paid a visit to the #ribevikingecenter. We were not disappointed, a lovely market with lots of 'viking' weaponry, drinking-horns, jewelry, and what not. Staff dressed up as Vikings demonstrating their skills on forging blades, spinning and dying wool, woodcrafts and more. I also liked to see how building techniques evolved from simple huts and shed-like houses to the 'fachwerk'-houses
Look what I found today in Ribe: a pretty river flowing through the city, a crooked door and the love of my life posing for me🥰

Happy midsummer from @bodezwaan @marcelvanmullem  and me! We had  great fun harvesting☺️🌞☀️❤️✨
Finally some rain after over a month of draught! 🤸🤸‍♀️🤸‍♂️
Tuin rijkdom: hoewel de hitte een flinke tegenstander is voel ik me toch rijk met de dingen die wel goed gaan
Gardening wealth:even though the heat is a formidable adversary I still feel rich with all that does go right

'Getting your hands dirty will make you feel better' True, only after planting 100 onions 12 cucumbers and a bout 2 dozen sunflowers ánd clearing the old strawberry bed my back disagrees 🤭 't Was a lovely day to do it though!

Some of the things that made me happy today when walking on a nearby little piece of wood/park: Checkerboard flowers (Kievitsbloem) and the fresh green of the Hawthorne (Meidoorn). @bodezwaan and I saw many more beautiful plants starting to bud and even though the weather may not have been the best, We still enjoyed our walk, which is to me the best way to celebrate Ostara. So happy Ostara everyone!
Melting snow hanging from the roof of our porch (Christmas should be in december, right?😊)
Today I rebuild our herbal spiral/ hill, it was exactly the right day to do it: the weather was great, Maria Thun approved (BD-gardening)it was not even cold, the ground not too wet or dry and I'm happy with the result, might add a few extra rocks an herbs.

Deze vrouw waar ik al zoveel jaren ongelooflijk veel van hou! Happy Valentijn lieve @bodezwaan ❤️❤️❤️❤️💥✨
Placed peas and beans seedlings in our new greenhouse, carefully watered them and thoroughly enjoyed rubarb and garlic doing so well! 🌱🌱🌱🌱☺️
Finally finished our new greenhouse together with @marcelvanmullem. It should have been there almost a year ago but there were a lot of setbacks: it took ages to ship from the UK, then  it turned out one of the packages with glass was shattered. Having the glass cut here in NL turned out to be incredibly expensive, replacing the broken glass would cost almost as much as a complete new greenhouse. So then a new package was sent from the UK and arrived almost complete and whole: only two pieces were broken, but we decided to use some parts of previous greenhouse we were never able to build because a storm molested the frame before we could even start to put the glass in 🫣. But now we have it and we can start out with broad beans and marrowfat peas (kapucijners) 🎉🎈
Our house is being well garded! (So there is even more use to cats than being couch decorations, vibration highteners, love spenders, keeping you busy feeding and cleaning, evening amusement-parks and what more 😊)
Our new couch-dwellers.. 😊😍

Diminishing light of autumn..
Autumn, the good part: nice and quiet, rich in colour, not to cold or to wet, if just all autumn could be this way it would most definitely be my favorite season
#autumn #fall
Today my allotmentpartner @marcelvanmullem and I started the build of a new greenhouse. Apart from finding the usual parts that require taking the greenhouse apart again😄, all went very well
Even pastinaak halen van de moestuin, we hebben ze wel eens nóg groter gehad, maar ik vind het toch altijd weer heel leuk en bevredigend om zo iets moois en lekkers uit de klei te trekken 😊❤️🍆🥔🥕#oogst #moestuin #allotment
We had a little rain when working in the garden
Sometimes I find some odd bits of wood, the ones that  just have a magic 'pling'. I'll pick m up, usually keep them in my pocket or sometimes even in a drawer, but eventually it will pop up and screams to be freed..
'Liv', our beloved cat for almost ten years is not doing very well to say the least. Like many older cats she has kidney problems and we know they won't go away. She is hardly eating or drinking anything ( we try anything, the things she manages/likes to eat in tiny bits one moment, will be refused the next) and we are unable to sneak in any medicine. Of course this won't last and we'll just have to come to terms with that and try to make her as comfortable as possible. It is this strange time of mixed emotions feeling gratitude for the wonderful time we had with her, our silly tail-less cat, the despair for not being able to do anything more and the sadness of having to say goodbye to yet another family member that is much loved and has been the source much joy, laughter and comfort.

Evening-walk in the woods around Nunspeet, no moon yet, although..
The love of my life, my faery of the woods, married for 33 years today @bodezwaan
Voor het eerst eens 'echt' met olieverf gewerkt in een les van @hildeschaap, aakt naar meer.
New, now also available on Vero! 😊 Try Vero, it will not decide what you see or what you post, no adds (so far). No FB connection, no suggestions, so it might be getting used to and you probably won't find every one back, certainly not instantaneously. But it will only work if enough people will join.
Lovely walk in the Dunes and forest around Bergen. Despite the drought there was an abundance of acorns and Rohan berries. And to top it of a robin came to us, first it sat next to our feet, then sat next to us on a bench where we were enjoying the view. Alas it was too fast to capture, but it felt very special in a good way
Behalve een paar kilo aan sperziebonen, wat haricots verts en wat mais deze keer ook erg genoten van de bloemen in het avondlicht (de kleuren die je ziet krijg ik nog steeds nooit op mijn toestel) Gesproeid moet er even goed nog wel, de warmte is voorbij, maar de droogte duurt zo te zien nog wel een week. Gelukkig droogt het nu iets minder snel weer op.
#moestuin
En dan wordt je omgeleid omdat er een weg afgesloten is, tijdens de omleiding blijkt ook de omleiding niet afgemaakt te kunnen worden(of ik heb gewoon een bord gemist) en dan brengt je navvi je zomaar op een pontje bij Akersloot. Hoe mooi is dat?!
Dat wordt heel veel pompoensoep 😄 En wortels en boontjes en bieten en prei en...
Samen met mijn lieve partners in crime @bodezwaan en @marcelvanmullem hebben we nou al jaren een flinke moestuin en dat betekent  plezier en de lasten een beetje verdelen. Vandaag mocht ik tot voorbij zonsondergang de boel weer het hoognodige water geven. En dan wil je toch weer plaatjes maken van de prachtige rijkdom die zo'n tuin is.😍
Hazelworm, geen echte slang, wel erg mooi, kronkelde over ons pad - gauw even op een wat vochtiger plekje uitgezet. Maar wel eerst even op de foto natuurlijk
Koffie met gebak aan de beek op ons vakantieadres, met de voeten in het koele water: beter wordt vakantie niet! 😊

Hachenburg, Germany: these pictures are almost a manual how to build 'Fachwerkhäuser', put up a sturdy frame from squared trees and fill up the gaps with almost anything. If you look closely you can see the traditional way which is a mixture of straw and loam (much like adobe) and braided twigs.
When your daughter moves house, buys a lot of stuff from the big swedish furniture shop, of course you help her putting all the stuff together and take home all the packaging.. #weekendchoresdone
Many cherries🍒🍒, bake cherry -cake 😋😋😋
Oogst, v.l.n.r.: tuinbonen, peultjes, doperwten en kapucijners. Sommige doperwtjes zouden ook nog wel eens peultjes geweest kunnen zijn 😄(zelfde familie, je herkent ze niet aan de plant en we waren een beetje druk, stond bij elkaar in een vak en geeft verder niks) Vooral met de kapucijners ben ik erg blij; goede opbrengst en ook erg mooi in elk stadium.
Goats at the Bakkum camping terrain
Sinds enige tijd ben ik gestopt met het actief volgen van het nieuws. Ik kijk geen journaals, nieuws-shows of praatprogramma's, lees geen krant meer en heb de nieuws app van mijn telefoon geknikkerd. 99,9 % van het nieuws items  gaat over zaken die ik niet kan veranderen, die niet bijdragen aan mijn 'peace of mind', laat staan dat ik er blij van wordt. Het gros van de dingen heeft niet eens ( inhoudelijke)  invloed op mijn leven. Bovendien zijn de nieuws item de laatste jaren steeds explicieter geworden. Ik heb geen behoefte aan de berichten over hoe bijvoorbeeld de Mexicaanse drugsmaffia en de overheid elkaar bestrijden en al helemaal niet over de details van de aangebrachte lichamelijke schade.  Gek genoeg is het heel informatief om geen nieuws te volgen, ik kan het van harte aanraden.
Nog even een krop andijvie halen en dan genieten van hoe mooi het er voor staat. De paarse bloem is van de Capucijnders.
Weekend fun jobs: painting the ceiling over the staircase, yay! 🙄
Beautiful Digitalis or Vingerhoedskruid in the woods around Putten
Even a few days with my lovely @bodezwaan  at @campingdevriendschap  feel like a complete vacation. Of course our little chalet is immediately Bo-ified like no one else can, loving it! 😍
🙄Today we had to decide  to, hopefully temporarily, shut our give-away-closet. Some ill-raosed kids from the neighborhood kept on taking stuff out and then ruining it and throw it away in the bushes along the road. They would take it out and run away with it, seeing it as a sort game like we would as a child ring a doorbell and run off. It gave us to much stress and people wouldn't put any new stuff in it anymore. 
We will try putting it up closer to our front door and see how that goes.

Gardening fun; So great to see almost everything starting to grow and bloom! It has been dry the last few weeks, I've spent well over an hour watering all the seedlings and other plants.
Happy and blessed Beltane everyone! 🔥❤️💥

Happy Imbolc everyone, it has begun! ❇️
Forbidden demonstration against COVID measures. According to mainstream media it was a grim atmosphere and 2000 participants. I had great time and nothing happened apart from a tiny quarrel, and there were easily 10.000 people.
Find your roots in the woods! My lovely Bo, connecting with the tree-people of Schoorl
Our 'Give-away-cupboard' is working like a charm!❤️it is so much fun and so rewarding to see how many people stop by, some just to see what's new, some bring new stuff, and some take whatever they like. Especially now the days are shorter and the weather is cold and grey, it seems to have become a sort of attraction, a goal for people making a small walk, for children to check it out.😊
Happy Yule! This shortest day also was one of the brightest since quite some time - and a pretty cold one . Just had to check if it was truly frozen...

Weekendchores step 4: finishing peeling off the tape - so rewarding ❤️! Screwing everything back on and putting the doors back ,Yay!! 🍻. #weekendchores
Weekendchores step 3: the really hard part *wipes sweat off*, waiting for the paint to dry, do some shopping and making coffee.  #weekendchores
Weekend hotels step 2: taping off, some dust wiping, protecting the terrace and then slapping the paint on. Sorry for the drama queens, male or female, the change in colour is ever so subtle, lucky me: it only needs one coat ☺️. #weekendchores
This weekend's chore, step 1: take out the doors, take off the handles, clean them an then sand them until you've got nice tingling hands.  #weekendchores
Happy Manon everyone!
How can one not love @bodezwaan  especially when she surprises you by taking you out for dinner for being married for 32 years! Love you 4ever darling!❤️❤️❤️
A little leftover from my holliday in  Limburg, an old and or exhausted bumblebee sat on a windowsill and didn't mind stepping on my hand so I could carry it to a flower ...

Walk around Puth, Limburg NL, (sound on)
Rainy walk in Limburg (NL), the last picture is a corner of a flooded cornfield where duck are swimming. Nice walk nevertheless.

Sorry, I couldn't resist!  On the other hand, I 'm pleased with the result. Now I'll have to wait until I'm back home so I can glue the pin to it.

#hereforthestills  a piece I made 40 years ago, it's the lid of a box I carved as a present for my dad. Didn't have any decent tools back then, which only makes me more proud of what I accomplished as a 19 year old.

Midzomer traditie vlierbloesemlimonade maken. Net geplukt na de regen, met voor het eerst sap van onze eigen citroenen, yum!
Okay, okay.. I think I should share this. Last week my mother died at the age of 87. Our relationship wasn't going very well for quite a long time. I won't share details. I thought I'd be relieved and go on with my live. Of course that didn't happen. Part of me is relieved, both for me as for her, since she hated getting more depending and got grumpier and sometimes even spiteful. Part of me is out of balance. Now I am the oldest in our family, energetically things are shifting and still quite topsy turvy. Working on the closet and the garden did help quite a lot though.
Kadootje: Wie wat bewaart die heeft wat. Wie wat weggeeft, die heeft meer!
Present: One who keeps something, has something, (Dutch saying), One who gives something has more! (My addition)
The Dutch saying stems from a time when everything was scarce and one was warned not to use up, or eat everything, but to keep stuff for a longer period because it was unknown when there would be replenishment.
Capucijnders, groep en bloei ❤️
It works! People give and take! Happiness, sprinkle that shit everywhere!
Ready! (Well almost)
Give away closet in progress!

Last beetroot and almost the last parsnip, fresh and tidied 😋
This weekend's chore done! Fresh wood-chippings on our garden paths.
When gardening I like to work with Nature, but sometimes there is the occasional quarrel: I wanted to get rid of some raspberry-bushes that were taking over not only the garden, but also the paths.. So far bushes 0, Claus 1. But I'm pretty sure coming spring some of the roots will make a  re-occurrence for the next battle. Arrr!
Some beech and mushroom leftovers from our Wolfheze visit

Happy with the result: My DIY for this weekend, most of it was already finished yesterday, today was doing the last edges and cleaning up, which always takes me longer than expected..
Almost December, but still flowering! 💖

The very last harvest from our tiny greenhouse this season
For Dr Who fans: crack in the universe on a mushroom near Schoorl (village in the dunes of northern Holland,)
Installed an outdoor outlet, closed of the side of the porch and plugged in a terrace heater, presto!
Still a bit rough around the edges, but hey, it's up and finished for today!
Dried some of our last raspberries in the oven, couple of hours on100 C
End of summer colours at our vegetable garden / Nazomerkleuren in onze moestuin
Prima oogst weer vandaag: een stuk of tien komkommers, 2 bakjes haricot verts, bieten, ijsbergsla, nog wat frambozen gesnoept, en een venkel. Prachtig allemaal en de rode uien te drogen gelegd: ideaal met de warmte. Alleen jammer dat muizen het merendeel van onze mais hebben gegeten terwijl het nog niet rijp was...
Oogstfeest-vuurtje
Zo, daar is ie dan, klaar: de Vuilbek-Fladder!  En zeg vooral niet die schattig is want je wordt helemaal ver*** gescholden: gemalen glas in zijn valse snavel

Weekend!!
My wife and her new lover... Sigh
Sommigen noemen dit tuinafval, voor mij is dit kunst van de natuur
Geen werk is niet niks doen, heerlijk in onze moestuin gewerkt om m'n hoofd leeg te maken, m'n hart te vullen en kreeg dit kadootje toen ik pauzeerde van het spitten in de klei
