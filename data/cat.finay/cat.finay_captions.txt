Happy birthday Ter Bear!! Out of all the millions of years of this universe, I am so fortunate to be friends with you in the same lifetime 🩵 @hozier was also fortunate to have us at his concert (ur welcome andrew)
On today’s episode of “Cat at a Cat Show”… 😻🫶🐈
Finally out of age 23 and into the blissful age of 24. Here’s some of my favorite moments as a 23 year old <3
I’ve never felt more safe at a bar than at Taylor Fest surrounded by women who all love @taylorswift as much as I do. Seriously one of the most fun nights and I got to go with my bestie @hannah.mccall AND I got to say “we’re on the list” at the door and I’ve never felt cooler :)
All I’ve been saying for the past 2 months is that I wanted to be snowed in at my childhood home one last time before I leave it and move out. I got that and a bonus of my sister being home when it happened #nostalgic
Reminiscing over my solo trip to CO. This song sounds exactly how it felt to be immersed in the nature trails at the Rockies — a sense of childlike wonder and in awe of the magnificent mountainsides.
It’s not Christmas yet, everyone pls enjoy the fall leaves first
CO part ✌️: Colorado Springs, Pikes Peak, visiting one of my high school besties, great views. 

Swipe to hear my genuine reaction of when I broke through the clouds
It’s Marti’s birthday!!!! I’m so lucky to have @martijo_hall as a friend! She is truly the most amazing person who goes above and beyond for the people she loves. She da best fr 💛
The most jaw-dropping trail I’ve ever hiked — and i did it solo! Here’s what I learned and observed: 

* talking to strangers on the trail was easier than I thought it would be (I’m introverted) especially bc we all had something in common: enjoying this dang pretty hike and taking multiple breaks bc of the altitude
* Asking someone to take a photo of you bc you’re alone is not a hassle. Pro tip - ask the girlies. They know how to get the good angles. Don’t ask the men, they’ll take one single photo of you and it will be horrible lol
* Take the time to journal. Once I got to the lake, I climbed my way over to some rocks away from people, brought out my journal and just started writing. Something about having a beautiful view in the morning sun will really make you think. 
* Last but not least, I learned that I really enjoy my own company and that’s all I’ll ever need. 

I recommend the mountains man… it’ll change ya. 🥾🌲🏔️
Worth the 950 mile drive
Happy international cat day🫶 here are some of my favorite Luca moments (this was really really REALLY hard for me to narrow down to 10 photos/vids) (half my camera roll is of her) (I spent over an hour picking these out) (she’s so silly) #internationalcatday #cats
Happy birthday to my built-in best friend — I’m so glad I got to grow up with you by my side every day. I couldn’t have lived a better life without you in it! Love ya sis 💚 @madel.snapp
3rd year in a row we went to Stickyz for @shannonnerys ‘s birthday🥳 but maybe now a new tradition of going to an arcade?? I’m always down to clown 🤪 Happy 23rd Shannon!!
If you’re looking for me, I’ll be staring at this photo I took last night for the rest of the day
Recently
#theerastour was the best concert I have ever been to and will ever go to.

Video 1: Opening song right when we saw @taylorswift for the first time

Video 2: You belong with me

Video 3: The loudest screams I’ve ever heard and done when Taylor officially announced Speak Now TV

Video 4: Taylor and @phoebebridgers sing Nothing New live for the first time ever (we felt so special)

Video 5: Our reaction to Phoebe bringing out @xboygeniusx in her opening act (big big surprise)
May the Fourth be with you💫 #ilovestormtroopers
Happy (1 day late) birthday to my spontaneous, life-of-the-party, beautiful buffoon of a friend @la_rellllll 🕺🏻✨
Cried a little when I walked in the butterfly garden. Also I was freaking out because they had like 20 bonsai trees and literally last week I discovered that I love bonsai trees. Did you know that any tree can be bonsai-ed? Crazy right?? (Lol and now that I posted I realized I doubled the last pic and didn’t show the bonsai tree haha)
Recreated some pics of me at Versailles in 2016, except this time it was the dead of winter instead of the dead of summer ❄️ I was such a baby back then
Note to self: Parisians don’t wear ripped jeans. (The amount of weird looks I got were astonishing)
Happy New Year! 2023 is my year I can feel it :)
Paris day un and deux! Swipe to see me livin my best first day, my mom on FaceTime being jealous, a vid of my solo trip back to the hotel, and then a pic of me being flustered in the metro (aka my face when anyone bumps into me and says “Pardon”)
Call me Cat the college graduate
Swipe to see my dad wearing this exact cape in the 80s 👀 #halloween

Little did I know I would gain 8 new friends this summer. Happy national intern day!
@martijo_hall and I finally got a picture together last night. Stay tuned for the next photo we get together in like 3 years
🌼Spring semester 2022🌼

These past 5 months have been the most difficult and trying semester I’ve had at A-State, but also the most rewarding. I pushed myself, made closer and tighter friendships, and did a lot of self reflection. I love my A-State art and design crew and can’t wait to see what’s in store for my last semester.
Don’t go chasin waterfalls… unless you’re with friends on a marked trail in the middle of the day on a popular hiking trail
Spring break in Gatlinburg:)
I would much rather be here than watch some random football game #hamilton
Manifesting another year full of growth and new experiences. Here’s to #22 🎂🤠
Easily the best concert I’ve ever been to. Thank you Harry for an amazing show and come back to Arkansas!! 

Also I sobbed.
Caught the light being cute n’ all
Happy 21st Shea baby!! I love you so muchhhhhhh

First pic, look cute with the wine. Second pic, realizing how disgusting it was.
@martijo_boren please don’t take the boys home tomorrow. I love them too much🥺
No more sitting around on spring break. I will forever take trips now
Had to get at least 1 ass photo
Happy Galentines day from my girls!
Snow/ice turns me into a giddy excited kid and I love it

Went camping with some amazing people, swam in the very very cold Buffalo River, and only fell once during the hike. #Arkansas
Sometimes I forget to post... oops. Thanks @photography.by.martijo for this amazing shot
Ya know, just another day with purple hair :) Finally did what I have been wanting to do for so long! .

As the black lives matter movement is fading away on instagram and other social media outlets, I want to remind everyone that it is not over and there is still so much you can do! I have been using this time to educate myself on these issues by doing research and doing something as simple as watching netflix shows and documentaries that bring to light the discrimination and injustices that blacks face in the US. Click the link in my bio to find a list of petitions that you can sign in support of the blm movement.
Headed one way and spontaneously ended up at another
Hoping @acovi08 has the happiest of birthdays today!! So glad this girl popped in my life! Can’t wait to see you and actually celebrate when this is all over! 🥰
Don’t forget to show your poptart some love by having a photo shoot with him
At least I don’t have to social distance from nature #nofilter

It’s time for me to get in my groove again and be the best version of myself. 2020 is the year of focusing on what makes me happy, building on my friendships, and putting myself out there  #allin
My dear friend Rebekah was in a fatal accident last night. She was walking on campus and was hit by a car. She had too much brain damage and passed away earlier today. I was lucky enough to have gone to the hospital and got to see her and say my goodbyes. Friends and family are in my thoughts. 
Rebekah, 
You have such a beautiful soul. Normally in times like this, people say the nicest things. And for you, I only have amazing memories and nice thoughts. No bad memories, nothing bad to say at all. You are the most positive person I’ve met and one of the best people I’ve ever known. 
Growing up with you was such a blessing for me. You are such a light to everyone who has ever met you. Rebekah, you are just so special. I didn’t know that when my family joined community group that we would form such a good relationship. And even build on it in our small group at church. All the years of playing kick the can in our yard, having the boys dodge our feet as we were swinging as high as we could on the swing set, and the years of growing closer to you will be memories that I’ll keep forever. 
This past year of going to concerts and little house shows have been some of my favorite memories ever and I’m so glad that we made them together. I feel like I’ve grown so much closer to you in this past year. Since we were finally growing up and becoming more ourselves, I got to see your personality shine even more. 
You are one of a kind, and I’ll never forget you. You have a lasting place in my heart. Love you.
Matching PJs are a must-have for Christmas from now on. Merry Christmas everyone!
We need more colorful bathrooms in our lives
Green is a nice color
Just taking the time to appreciate my favorite girls! Also, movie nights on the football field is actually so fun
Change doesn’t happen by doing nothing. Change happens when you constantly stand up for what you believe in and take action. Our protest may be small in comparison to the ones in big cities, but no matter the size we are making a difference and bringing light on the most important issue our world has ever faced. I want a future. And my future is not determined by my education, it’s determined by what my government and other governments around the world do to protect the only home we have. My education doesn’t matter, future generations do. #climatestrike #fridaysforfuture @astate_environmental_club
Fake laughter indeed brings real laughter

At home for Labor Day weekend having to do lots of homework when really I want to be cuddling up in some pillows.
All moved in and just finished my first day of classes! // also, if a water slide opportunity presents itself, you must take it.
If you look closely, you can see @annabchil in my sunglasses being a true friend (one who’s willing to take more photos of me than I am of her🤭)
Bye beach. See ya later.🤙🏼
Vacay ☀️
Wednesday trip to Greer’s ferry means little crowds and loads of fun w/ @madel.gx
Dreaming of traveling again.
These friends, family members and teachers were the best part of high school for me. I’ve been friends with some since kindergarten at Robinson and some since 9th grade. But each and every one of them mean the world to me and I’m so glad to have finished so strong with these friends by my side.
Golden hour and beautiful sunsets means taking a bunch of photos for Instagram! Happy #seniorsunday
Thank you all for supporting me through all of high school! Thanks for making Academic Signing day so special! Love you all!
I had the best date and of course we had to do the classic #prom pose. Also yes, I was almost chased by ducks. And don’t we have a good lookin group??
I do love #donuts but I also love that I only have 30 more days left of school. Any other #seniors out there that are ready to graduate already?
My sister is so lucky to have married her best friend. I can’t wait to see this relationship grow deeper and better each day! #thesnappwedding
“Are you looking at me?” - My Mom is the cutest. Can’t believe we had the top of Pinnacle all for ourselves for the sunset. #blessed
I don’t usually post me playing, but I’m just in love with this song and thought you guys should hear.
We’ve waffled before and we’ll waffle again. #winterformal2018 #formal #wafflehouse
Happy birthday to one of my best friends since 7th grade! Thanks for being so awesome and always being there for me! #18

The Doors of Dublin date back to the 1700s. These doors have been with us for centuries and here I am standing in front of one of the oldest.
Trees 🌿
That time we went to see the Palace of Versailles gardens and got blown away by the beauty.
Actually being in Paris looking at the sparkling Eiffel Tower was the most mesmerizing moment of the whole trip.
I wanted to rip off my clothes and jump in the water, it was so hot! Wales is gorgeous 🌊
A couple days late
This house could be mine in the future

When you love someone so much, you'll never be able to take any functional pictures like you did when you first met them. @gracemitchell24 is a cool person who probably feels the same as she did yesterday but something's different about her. She's 15 today. And I'm wishing her the best of birthday wishes! Love you like a lot
Have a rad rest of your birthday! I feel like I've known you since the 90's even though we weren't even born yet. Glad I became friends with this fab girl @emilymc313
I'll reach for the sky and feel alive again

The pianokeys are black and white, but they sound like a million colors in your mind
Thanks for letting it snow at least once this year ❄️
