Trying to smile through the continuously growing sh*tshow that is 2020... Emphasis on trying!! 🙃
I have debated posting anything on social media because now is the time to lower my voice so I can raise up the voices of  BIPOC, both in this country and around the world. That being said, I feel as though I should make my stance perfectly clear: Black Lives Matter. Black lives have always mattered. Black lives will always matter. To all of my friends and family who believe that “all lives matter”, I agree with you. But all lives can’t matter until black lives matter to EVERYone. Period. Changes in law enforcement, the justice system, and the voting system need to happen in order for progress to be made.
It’s snow problem ❄️

Just some of my favorite architecture/ nature pics i’ve taken while in France!
I can’t believe it, but 5 weeks has come and gone in the blink of an eye! Studying abroad has been one of the best experiences of my life up to this point, and I have everyone in these photos to thank for that. I learned so many new things about not only the world, but myself as well. Au revoir (for now) Paris, you’ve been a real one! ❤️🌇

Congratulations to everyone in The Bluest Eye! It was an amazing show full of heartfelt and real moments delivered by a beautiful and inspiring cast! I love you all! One more chance to see it in the Burg tomorrow at 2!
Dear Megan,
I first of all wanted to thank you for coming into my life in August and for being crazy enough to stick around. You are one of the many reasons that OCU feels like home away from home. Thank you for being such a supportive, kind and (crazy) friend. Whether it be our crazy loud laughing sessions or our deep late night talks, you never fail to show how much you care.
Love, Andrew
Oh yeah, Happy 19th Birthday! ❤️
Did you know... there are 31,536,000 seconds in a year? Happy New Years! 🎉🎊
Ain’t no party like an ugly sweater party cuz an ugly sweater party don’t stop ☃️🎄

Happy Birthday!! I hope it’s a good one! I refuse to believe that you’re driving now.. 😳
I’m so happy to be back in school with these lovely ladies, who both did extremely well in Lord of the Flies, (along with the rest of the amazing and inspiring cast)... Heritage High School takes on OCU #grit
