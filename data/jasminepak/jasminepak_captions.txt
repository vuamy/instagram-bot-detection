Is 7th Street Burger really the “best burger” in NYC? 

I think I’ll need to try some more burgers in nyc before I make that claim, but it was sure as hell super delicious! (and defffff better than Shake Shack - yes i said what i said!!)

And perhaps i’m pissing off a whole other group here, but their fries were defffff better than BOTH In-N-Out’s and Shake Shack’s 🍟 

I need to hear from y’all — got any spots that you think can beat 7th Street? Drop em in the comments so I can add them to my list for my next NYC trip!!!

Chinatown is always on my must-visit list when I visit NYC. I lived there for 3 months when I was interning for a summer in NYC and I have such fond memories 🥹I’ll always remember running downstairs and walking over to mom and pop shops to get a plate of dumplings before walking back to my apartment with boba. I loved seeing the elders take an early morning walk, doing stretches at the park, chat with other fellow neighbors - so wholesome and beautiful to feel the strength of the community 🫶

I know I missed a lot of great eats on this food tour, so  let me know if there’s any places you’d like me to hit up in the future <3

Everything I ate at Din Tai Fung ~ brunch date edition! @dintaifungusa

Happy AAPI month! My favorite way to share my love for my culture is through food, and as your neighborhood Din Tai Fung ambassador (and longtime DTF fanatic), I had to get refuel with some of my favorite Taiwanese eats.

I got lots of suggestions to try the DTF hack where you order a side of sea salt to dip your favorite dessert xiao long bao in, and if you’re a sea salt lover, I’d say it’s definitely worth a try!

Drop your go-to DTF order in the comments!

@nanasgreentea_newyork is now in NYC and the place was PACKED! Consider going in during shoulder hours so you can grab a table and enjoy the atmosphere of the cafe!

Side note — anyone else out there also team hojicha over matcha? 👀
Some ASMR overpacking for my NYC trip! I prepared for some chilly and rainy weather and I love packing leggings to wear under my pants so I can rewear them at least a few times. Plus, they keep me extra warm!

I love NYC 😭 manifesting a bicoastal life one day 🤞🗽

Made Pad Thai for the first time and was in LOVE! Never knew how easy it was to make from home! I used the recipe from @hotthaikitchen and it was so so good, highly recommend!

I let the noodles sit for a littleeeeee too long so next time I know what not to do! I also need to run back to the store for palm sugar since they were out of stock when I made this. 

All in all, if this already tasted 10/10, can’t wait to make some tweaks and get it to 15/10 as it was meant to be enjoyed 😍

Since our Vietnamese wedding is a reception-only event, I’ve been on the hunt for a cute lil bridal mini, midi, or ankle length dress that I can party in!

I got a few dresses to try on from home to gauge the feel and it’s gotta pass a few tests — the can i dance test, can I raise my arms test, is it comfortable test, and most importantly… the can I eat in this test!!!

Overall these dresses were sooooo cute, but I’m still on the hunt! I may have to re-order dress #2 with straps for my bachelorette or something…

If you have any suggestions on options for reception dresses, please do let me know in the comments!!! 

All the dresses I’m showing here are linked in my LTK (link in bio)
I think these are some of the best snacks to hit the U.S. market in a long time. These Goldfish Crisps are gonna be a part of my routine snack rotations for sure.

Come join us on our wedding food tasting for our local reception! Both my family and George’s family met for the first time (as in everyone at once) and it was such a great time! George’s 104 year old grandma was of course the star of the show. She’s soooo cute!

George and I are having a much smaller destination wedding next year and felt that having a local reception with family and friends who won’t be able to travel, like grandma, would mean the world to us.

We’re having our Vietnamese reception at @paracelrestaurant which is famous in the OC Vietnamese wedding scene for amazing food. Probably not so surprising, food was my #1 priority for our reception. Good food = good time, baby!!!

I’ve been making a lot of comfort foods from my friends’ cultures lately and decided to start filming them! :) Let’s call it… Comfort Kitchen maybe? Comfy Cuisine? If this becomes a series, I am open to name suggestions 😂

When I asked one of my besties, Helen, she responded in 1 millisecond that Hong Kong Baked Pork Chop was her favorite comfort food from home. 

This Hong Kong cafe classic starts with a beautiful bed of fried rice followed by a layer of juicy and flavorful pork chops before finally being topped with a tomato mixture and a layer of gooey, melted cheese.

It’s hearty, rich, delicious, and most definitely comforting. 

Full recipe can be found on my website! https://jasminebellepak.com/hong-kong-baked-porkchop/

Rumor has it that @nep.cafe is gonna be the new IT dinner spot in Irvine, so I obviously had to try it!!!

Snag a reservation before you’re waiting a month to get in! My hot tip is to head in during a weekday right at 5pm so you can beat the crowds. I went in on a Monday at 5pm and it started filling up before 5:30pm.

(scallops, shrimp, calamari, coconut, thai chili, mango, shrimp chips)

🍽️ Whole Branzino (great for sharing)
(herbs, turmeric, peanuts, wrap set, rice noodle)

🍽️ Pork Tomahawk (great for sharing)
(honey glaze, crispy onion, watercress, nuoc cham, peanuts)

🍽️ Boneless Ribeye (great for sharing)
(20oz ribeye, tamarind sauce, herbs, scallion, peanuts)

🍽️ Beef Belly Noodle (great as an individual portion)
(beef belly, rice noodle, nuoc cham, pickles, peanuts, herbs)

🍽️ Vietnamese Shaking Beef (also great as an individual portion)
(filet, butter soy, rice, watercress)

🍽️ Banana Bread Pudding (this might have been the best banana bread pudding I’ve ever had)
(black sesame corn flake, banana toffee)
This is what we order at @dintaifungusa as a Taiwanese family!!

Din Tai Fung is always the first place we suggest when choosing somewhere to eat. We all love it, the quality is unmatched, and let’s be real… we want those garlicky green beans.

So if you were to ever come to dinner with me and my family at Din Tai Fung, this is what you’d be eating! Of course there are some other beloved items on the menu that we didn’t get this time around, so if you want to see another video on some of our other favorites, let me know!

Still thinking about these delicious and luxurious works of art from @wafubento.socal for our fancy date night in!!! 🍣

Sushi is one of my favorite foods and it hurts my soul that George NEVER craves sushi. It’s also so rare for him to say that he loves a sushi experience, so this was a big win !!!!

Wafu Bento’s ingredients are flown fresh from Japan and you can order through their website or via DM!

Seeds are not edible and are poisonous if crushed open.

Caption resumed from Part 2:

Construction - The resort was an active construction site. Loadsssssss of construction. We were waking up to noises of construction. Construction is happening right on the beach next to the chairs, right above our heads while we are eating, next to the pool that were are lounging at. Everywhere. No exaggeration. @george.nguyenz posted a video of a lot of the construction going on. Check it out on his page.

We spoke with several staff members. They are all aware that the resort is not ready. One of the managers informed us that investors came to stay in the resort to experience what guests would be experiencing and doors were falling off, water was not running, and several other issues. The resort was originally supposed to open in December of 2023 but pushed it to February 2024 due to operational issues. Come February, the staff was well aware of all the existing issues but not being open caused them to be hemorrhaging through money, which led them to ultimately decide to open. 

Personally, I wish they decided to finish construction and open when they were fully operational. We spoke with so many other guests during our stay and they were ALL experiencing the same issues as us, leaving them with several negative impressions, reviews, and complaints. 

While the staff is kind and welcoming, it is frustrating for us to have paid full price for an experience that is so different from what is marketed on the website. We were fully prepared to have no access to the Spa and Fitness Center, but arriving to the surprise of yellow rust water, half the eateries open, constant construction around the resort, and jacuzzis malfunctioning left us extremely disappointed.
 All cons aside, I will say my group and I made an effort to keep a positive outlook during the trip and had a very enjoyable time. If you’re unable to cancel your existing reservation to this resort, you’ll be astounded by the beauty. However, if you are able to cancel and make a reservation elsewhere, I’d highly recommend that.

#secretsplayablanca #secretsplayablancacostamujeres #mexicoresortreview #allinclusiveresort #mexicoallinclusive
Caption resumed from part 1 ⬇️

We arrived to the resort and the manager came out to give us a complimentary room upgrade from a King Ocean View to a Preferred King Ocean View which is a nicer side without construction and an outdoor balcony tub.

Upon checking into our room, we discovered yellow water in both our inside tub and outdoor tub, rendering the upgrade useless as we were unable to bathe in both our tubs the entire week. We asked to move rooms and after 2 days, they offered us a room on the side with a lot of construction and the water was still yellow. We declined.

We asked the staff what was causing the water to be yellow, and they said, “It is rust, but it’s not bad.” Ooofffff. If your water is running yellow with rust, you shouldn’t be opening your resort. The water definitely had a weird smell to it. 

We still had to wash ourselves every night in the shower, so we were unable to escape from the rust water and my skin definitely felt some harsh effects — irritation, itchiness, eczema flare-ups, etc. The water issue was not resolved by the time we left on 2/15/24.

Resuming caption in part 3!!!

Here’s the TEAAAAA 🍵 If you have plans to come to this new resort, CANCEL IT! Dropping all the tea on the new Secrets Playa Blanca Costa Mujeres resort we stayed at a couple weeks ago. 

This video is so long that I broke it up into 3 parts. All parts are up now.

Before we arrived, I had been scouring the internet for any information on this resort. Because it was so new (opened on 2/1/24) and our stay began on 2/8/24, there was very little information aside from the website.

The website only mentioned that the Spa and Fitness Center would not be open. However, we learned that not all restaurants and bars would be open. This was a huge disappointment because this is not listed on the website, and we specifically booked for all the eateries and the Jungle Bar, a gorgeous forested swim area with a bar. 

I was on the phone with Hyatt for several hours every day for 4 days before our trip trying to get us transferred to another resort. Several Hyatt representatives told us that the information I had was incorrect and that everything was open. It was NOT. We didn’t want to pay full price for a resort that is 50% open with loads of construction. They wouldn’t let us change it, reduce our nightly rate, or refund us any money, so we sucked it up and agreed to make the best of our trip to celebrate our friends’ birthdays.

‼️I don’t have enough space so caption is continued in part 2!!

not my dress getting dirtier and dirtier with each dessert 😂 this was mid September of last year and was going well into the high 90s, but this was one of sweetest moments from Japan — a cute picnic with my group by Kamo River in Kyoto with sunny blue skies, and our only concern was if we had enough stomach space for the next snack. good times :’)

[JAPAN DAY 8 VLOG]

I LOOOOOVE KYOTOOOOO!!!!! Kyoto is so darn beautiful! It feels like a movie!!! Some of my favorite memories from this Japan trip have been in Kyoto and the best piece of advice I can give to someone going to Japan is to not stack your itinerary.

Leaving room in your itinerary for exploring cute shops, local eateries, impromptu experiences, or literally just walking around can help you better soak in your travel experience!

I just need a full week in Kyoto. It’s such a romantic and beautiful place and when I go back, I’m definitely staying in a Ryokan!

last week i started collecting these little clips of poopy’s cat activation sounds because her little chirps make my heart melt so bad!!! 😭❤️she’s not a snuggly cat by any means (which is honestly good bc i’m really allergic to her and denying her cuddles would be very difficult), but these lil chirpy noises and how her eyes get all big when she sees me makes me bend at the knees. never thought i’d be a cat person but i gotta say, she’s pretty great 🥹

[VLOG] Japan Travel Diaries Day 2

Come spend the day at Tokyo Disneyland with us and check out my list below for how to optimize your Tokyo Disneyland visit if you are thinking about going!

Tokyo Disneyland Tips
- BOOK HOTELS EARLY! Reservations open up at 11am JST 3 months before your planned stay.
- Booking at a Disney hotel will get you a 15-minute early entry to the park. It doesn’t seem like much but can save you a lot of time. Use this pass to head to the most-popular rides first!
- You can purchase your park tickets online! Skip the line and purchase your park tickets online.
- Take a note of your must-ride rides. Plan around your non-negotiable and the rest can be bonus!
- FITS: It is very common to match with your partner, your friends, the group you’re going with at Tokyo Disneyland! 
- Download the Tokyo Disneyland Resort app! You can search locations, food items, obtain Disney Premier access (their lightning lane), and more
- Enchanted Tales of Beauty and the Beast ride is worth it.
- Try lots of food and if you’re thinking about buying that souvenir, get it! Tokyo Disneyland has several exlclusive menu items as well as merchandise. Take advantage of it while you’re there!

Eating my way through SF today! It’s been so long since I’ve been back in the Bay area! Last time I was in SF was after I graduated so it’s nice to go around the city again from a different perspective!

We did quite a few tours this visit and had a blast on this food tour where we got to walk around and talk to locals who showed us some iconic SF eats. You know it’s legit when all the Bay area peeps confirm the spots are top tier.

Yes cream cheese police, you can add cream cheese if you want! Call me crazy, but I prefer the crab by itself in all its glory 😋

Air Fryer Crab Wontons

Ingredients:
1 tbsp vegetable oil
1 tbsp piece fresh ginger, grated
1/4 red belle pepper, seeded and finely chopped
1 tbsp fresh cilantro, chopped
1/4 tsp garlic salt

Directions:
1. Heat oil in a nonstick pan over medium high heat.
2. Add the grated ginger and red bell pepper and stir-fry for 30 seconds
3. Add cilantro, mix well, and let cool.
4. Once slightly cooled, add crabmeat and salt and mix well.
5. Set up your wrapping station: wonton wrappers, water, crab mixture, a plate for wrapping, another plate to place wrapped wontons, and a damp paper towel to keep them from drying out.
6. Lay one wrapper on your wrapping plate with the point facing you. Add about 2 tsp of mixture to the center and fold the bottom point over to reach the top point and form a triangle. Make sure to squeeze as much air out as possible and seal.
7. Fold over the left and right edges over the center and seal.
8. Transfer to the “wrapped” plate and place damp towel over it to prevent it from drying out.
9. Repeat with remaining wrappers until you have no more mixture.
10. Spray generously with oil and air fry at 400F for 8-10 minutes flipping halfway through.
11. If choosing to deep fry, fry at 350F for 1 minute or until crisp and golden all over.
12. Transfer to serving dish and enjoy with sweet chili sauce!

Sometimes I think about how cute it is that I get to spend time with my mom grabbing cocktails and going to happy hour with her, trying new foods, gossiping, shopping, and so much more. It wasn’t long ago when I was just a little girl waiting for her to pick me up from school and I love how much our relationship has evolved into becoming best friends. So grateful for my mom always. She deserves the whole world 🥹❤️

Finally got to try the legendary Florentine sandwich shop All’Antico Vinaio (Rome location) ! I’ve never had a sandwich like this before and I NEED ANOTHER ONE! 😫

very jealous of all you NYCers who have a location there!! 

📍All’Antico Vinaio
Piazza della Maddalena, 3, 00186 Roma
If the food doesn’t blow my mind, I usually write the place off, but this was one of the first times where I felt the ambiance and service actually balanced out our experience with the food. We also kept looking at the table next to us who seemed to have ordered all the right things, and we couldn’t ignore their very audible commentary like “mmmm” and “oh that’s good!” Food jealousy is real! 

I really feel that I’d give this place another try and order different dishes just to experience the live jazz saxophone and gorgeous views again. I want to be “mmm”ing and “oh that’s good”ing next time 😂

You’ll see a bunch of spots selling Seafood Cones and Focaccia. Make sure to get one with anchovies to try the famous Monterosso anchovies, and look for the focaccia with caramelized onions! They were sold out when we went to this spot but we had one from another stand that was amazing!!

Italy Day 7 • Venice ~ Did you know Venice was built on 60ft long wooden piles driven deep into soil and clay ground? Being submerged underwater, the wooden piles petrified due to the oxygen-free conditions and provided a solid foundation for “The Floating City” we know it to be today!!!

It drives me insane that the best thing we ate in Italy was a complimentary amuse bouche that isn’t on their menu and I will probably never get to eat it again!!! 😭 I will have to try and recreate it at home so we can relive the fireworks we had in our mouths. If you find yourself in Cinque Terre, Buranco Agriturismo is certainly worth a visit — not just for the food, but for the atmosphere, and wine 🍷

ITALY DAY 3 - ROME [VLOG] 
A good trip always has BALANCE! If my itinerary is packed, I always make sure to plan chiller days so that we can recharge. Going full speed every day makes it hard for me to live in the moment and remember the details of my travels. I also love having some days that are fully open to leave room for walking around aimlessly and stumbling upon fun surprises. While I want to make sure we hit the hot spots, I also fill that desire of exploration to satisfy my wanderlust!!! 

What is your favorite way to recharge while traveling?

Don’t worry I hear y’all, I’m still cooking it up in the kitchen so y’all have some delicious recipe videos!! Today, we’re upgrading store-bought dumplings to some hot and sour dumplings 😋 

Hot and Sour Dumplings

Hot and Sour Sauce is for one serving of store-bought frozen dumplings (around 10 dumplings):

Ingredients for the Hot and Sour Sauce:
* 2 clove of garlic, minced
* 1/4 teaspoon of ground Sichuan peppercorn
* 2 tbsp hot oil
* 1 tablespoon of soy sauce
* 2 tablespoons of Chinese black vinegar
* 1 1/2 tablespoon of chili oil (adjust based on your heat preference)
* 1/2 teaspoon of sesame oil
* 1/2 teaspoon of sugar
* 2 tbsp chopped green onions
* Toasted sesame seeds to taste
* 1 teaspoon of finely chopped fresh cilantro (optional) 
Instructions:
1. Cook the dumplings according to the instructions on the package. 
2. While the dumplings are cooking, make the hot and sour sauce.
3. Combine the minced garlic and sichuan peppercorn and top with the hot oil.
4. Add soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, chili oil, and sesame oil and stir until the sugar is fully dissolved.
5. Once the dumplings are cooked, carefully drain them and place them in a bowl or on a plate.
6. Drizzle the hot and sour sauce over the dumplings. 
7. Top with green onions and toasted sesame seeds
8. Serve immediately and enjoy! 
Remember, the spice and sour levels in this recipe can be adjusted to taste. If you find the sauce too hot, reduce the amount of chili oil or Sichuan pepper. If it’s too sour, reduce the amount of vinegar.
My full food tour video on the Rome Twilight Trastevere Walking Food Tour with everyone’s favorite tour guide, Val from @eatingeurope! It was so hard to condense this into a short video as we were given SO much great information on this tour. This was our first food tour on our Italy trip and ended up being our favorite and I highly suggest you book this tour when you visit Rome! This is not sponsored, I seriously just had an amazing time on this tour! Great company, great food, great vibes all around. The amount of information, insight, and culture we got was just astounding and helped provide perspective for the entirety our trip.

Italy Travel Tip! We saved soooo much money in Italy because of the nasoni! If you end up buying bottled water, keep the bottle to refill from a nasone! 

There are 2,500 nasoni in Rome alone! Nasoni translates to “big nose.” Our guide told us that different regions around Italy have different water fountain designs so you may see some as dragons, lions, and more if you head to Venice, Tuscany, Florence, etc. 

Tap water in Italy is safe to drink so don’t be afraid of it! @george.nguyenz and I drank from it the entire 2 weeks we were there and had no issues. It honestly tasted better and was colder than the bottled water we had. Hot tip, you can type Nasoni in Google Maps and it’ll show you the nearest one to you!

#ad These Grilled Korean Marinated Short Ribs (Galbi) are ridiculously delicious. The char, the flavors, the tenderness!!!

I used my all electric Lumin Grill from @webergrills and am still obsessed with it! We never thought we’d be living out our grill dreams because our HOA doesn’t allow for any open flames, but here we are grilling some of our favorite recipes! 😌 

Find my recipe below! 

Grilled Korean Marinated Short Ribs
Ingredients:
* 2 ½ lb Korean beef short ribs, soaked in cold water for 30 minutes then patted dry
* ½ Asian pear, peeled, cored, and chopped
* ½ medium yellow onion, roughly chopped
* 1 ½” piece fresh ginger, peeled
* 7 cloves garlic
* ½ cup soy sauce
* ½ cup water
* ½ cup packed brown sugar
* ¼ cup honey (sub maple syrup)
* 1 tablespoon sesame oil
* 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, plus more as needed
* 1 green onion, chopped
* Toasted sesame seeds for garnish 
Instructions:
1. In a blender or food processor, combine the chopped Asian pear, chopped yellow onion, ginger, garlic, soy sauce, water, brown sugar, honey, sesame oil, and vegetable oil. Blend until smooth to create the marinade.
2. Place the beef short ribs in a large ziplock bag or a shallow container. Pour the marinade over the ribs, making sure they are well coated. Seal the bag or cover the dish and let the ribs marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, or ideally overnight.
3. Preheat your grill to medium-high heat or 450-500F. Remove the ribs from the marinade, allowing any excess marinade to drip off.
4. Grill the ribs for about 2-3 minutes per side, or until they reach your desired level of doneness.
5. Once cooked, transfer the ribs to a serving platter and let them rest for a few minutes.
6. Garnish the ribs with chopped green onions and toasted sesame seeds. 
7. Serve the Korean beef short ribs hot with steamed rice and your choice of side dishes, such as kimchi or pickled vegetables.
Thanks for having us @netflixbites ! If you haven’t heard, Netflix is opening a pop-up restaurant where you can eat foods from your favorite chefs from shows like Iron Chef, Chef’s Table, Nailed It!, Great British Bakeoff, and Drink Masters!!!

Our favorite dinner experience in NYC was at Tomi Jazz, a seemingly low-key Japanese live jazz bar that was actually bustling with noise both from local buzz and delightful tunes

I didn’t do a VO for this one so you could listen to the band’s amazing music. The restaurant also served up some delicious Japanese and Japanese Italian fusion dishes.

We waited over 2 hours on a weekday, so if you check it out, I’d highly suggest lining up 30 minutes before opening to avoid waiting as long as we did!

[TAIWAN VLOG DAY 11]  TW: Body Shaming, Eating Disorders

While my heart is filled with love for Taiwan and Taiwanese culture, it would be unwise to turn a blind eye to toxic societal norms within the culture. I am fully aware that it’s also not just Taiwanese culture, and spans across cultures around the world and I just wish that people would refrain from commenting on another person’s body PERIOD. 

It’s easy to tell someone to ignore the negativity and ignore the idiots, but in reality, it’s incredibly difficult. Also, truthfully speaking, I’m sick of ignoring the toxic comments. I now find myself calling aunties out and holding them accountable for what they’re saying. While it may be an easy comment for them to make, the aftermath of their words cause me to relive my childhood traumas. As I say this, I also admit I did not call my masseuse out for her comments, and I regret not speaking up and walking out.

I love myself and I love my body. It has kept me alive and allowed me to do things I love and that is what matters the most. I still love my culture and while it may be considered normal to make comments like this, I sure as hell don’t have to accept it. 

If you’ve ever experienced anything like this, please know that you are beautiful, you are loved, you are strong, and anyone making these comments are 10000% insecure in their own bodies and need to make comments like this to make themselves feel better. 

SO LET’S F*CKING EAT!!!!!

Still thinking about this sourdough bagel 🥯 @leosourdough @apollobagels
In the midst of life’s hustle and bustle, I’m constantly on the journey of reminding myself that simply existing can be enough. My friends and family regularly nudge me to hit pause and to give some self-care to myself. It sounds like a walk in the park, but for me, it’s a challenge that often feels like climbing a mountain.

When I’m racing through life at full speed, the mere thought of taking a breather feels like a curveball. I know coming to a full halt isn’t something I can realistically handle emotionally and mentally, so I’m trying to transition to a model moderate pace where I’m still on the move, but not sprinting at 100mph at all times.

Getting away from home, which for many of us, is now also our place of work, really helped physically and emotionally detach. And while I know it was just a temporary step away from reality, I’m hoping to bring a more sustainable balance to life in the long run where I don’t determine my value based on my productivity.

If you ever feel like you’re in this same boat, remember that your worth does not hinge on how much you work, your achievements, possessions, etc!! Existing and being can be enough! You are enough!!

These Air Fryer Chinese Salt & Pepper Chicken Wings from @jasminepak will FLY off the dinner table! #AAPImonth

Air Fryer Chinese Salt & Pepper Chicken Wings
Ingredients:
For the Chicken Wings:
-2 lbs chicken wings (about 20 wings), pat dry
-1/2 tsp black pepper
-3/4 tsp white pepper
-3/4 tsp salt
-1 tsp Chinese five-spice powder
-1/8 cup cornstarch

For the Stir-Fry Topping:
-2 tsp garlic, minced (about 4 cloves)
-2 tsp ginger, finely minced (or .5 tsp ground ginger)
-1/2-1 serrano pepper, finely sliced (optional, adjust to taste)
-1 red chili pepper, finely sliced (optional)
-2 green onions, finely sliced
-Cooking oil
-3/4 tsp white pepper
-3/4 tsp salt

Instructions:
1. In a large bowl, combine the chicken wings with black pepper, white pepper, salt, and half of the Chinese five-spice powder.
Toss until the wings are evenly coated.
2. Sprinkle the cornstarch over the chicken wings, ensuring all wings are evenly coated.
3. Preheat your air fryer to 350°F (175°C).
4. Arrange the chicken wings in a single layer in the air fryer basket. Avoid overcrowding; you may need to cook in batches depending on the size of your air fryer.
5. Spray the wings lightly with cooking spray. This will help them to become extra crispy. Avoid spraying cooking oil directly on the air fryer as it can damage your nonstick coating.
6. Cook for 10 minutes, then turn the wings and cook for another 10 minutes or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F. Cooking times may vary from machine to machine.
7. When the chicken wings are about halfway done, heat a small pan over medium heat. Add oil, then add the green onion, minced garlic, ginger, and if using, the sliced serrano and red chili peppers. Sauté until fragrant.
8. Add the remaining salt and Chinese five-spice powder to the pan and stir well.
9. Toss the cooked wings in the stir fry mixture.
10. Enjoy immediately!

This Grilled Korean Gochujang Chicken is so juicy, tender, and delicious! 

I used my all electric Lumin Grill from @webergrills and love, love, love it! 

George and I thought we’d never get a grill because our HOA doesn’t allow any open flames, but alas, the universe is on our side 😌

Find my recipe below!

Ingredients:
* 3 green onions
* 1.5 lb chicken thighs (skin on or off)
* 1 tbsp toasted sesame seeds

Sauce:
* 1/4 cup water
* 2 tbsp gochugaru (Korean chili pepper flakes)
* 2 tbsp gochujang (Korean chili paste)
* 1 tbsp plum syrup (sub honey or maple syrup)
* 2 tbsp mirin
* 1 tbsp sugar
* 1 tbsp soy sauce
* 1 tbsp oyster sauce
* 1/2 tbsp chicken bouillon powder
* 10 cloves garlic, minced
* 1/2 tsp ground ginger
* salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
1. Make the sauce. In a small bowl, combine water, gochugaru, gochujang, plum syrup, mirin, sugar, soy sauce, oyster sauce, chicken bouillon powder, minced garlic, ground ginger, salt, pepper, and mix.
2. In an airtight container, pour the sauce over the chicken thighs making sure they are evenly coated.
3. Marinate overnight, or for at least 1 hour.
4. Heat the grill to 400F.
5. Place the chicken thighs on the grill smooth-side down and cook for 5 minutes on each side until internal temperature reaches at least 165F.
6. Transfer grilled chicken thighs onto a plate and let it rest for 5 minutes. This will allow the juices in the chicken to redistribute and remain moist.
7. Enjoy with freshly steamed rice and top with green onions and toasted sesame seeds. 
8. Optional: pair with banchan of your choice, such as cucumber salad, kimchi, spinach, etc.

Would you stay in this hotel for $950 for 2 nights but get this gorgeous NYC city view?! 💰 

during my last NYC trip, I spent $0 out of pocket on 4 different hotels using credit card points, so I splurged on this hotel for a couple nights to experience the breathtaking NYC city views through the floor to ceiling windows. I can’t say that I’d stay here again because of the price tag and room size, but it definitely had some of the most gorgeous views I’ve ever enjoyed from a hotel and feel it was worth the experience and had a convenient location.

3 cups flour
1/2 tsp salt
1 cup boiling hot water
1/3 cup cold water
1 tbsp beet root powder

Ganache:
16 oz dark chocolate
1 cup heavy whipping cream
1. To your standing mixer, add the flour and salt. Mix well with paddle attachment.
2. Add the boiling hot water and pulse to incorporate.
3. Add the cold water and pulse to incorporate.
4. Switch to a dough hook and knead at medium speed for 10-12 minutes. The dough should look smooth and be slightly tacky.
5. Split in half. Place one half back in the mixer and add beet root powder. Knead on medium speed until fully incorporated, about 5 minutes.
6. Place both doughs in an airtight container or cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 20 minutes.
7. To make the ganache, add the chocolate and heavy whipping cream to a small pot and bring to a simmer over low heat.
8. Once simmering, turn off the heat and mix with a whisk until well blended.
9. Transfer to a small bowl and chill in the fridge for 2-3 hours until solid.
10. Prepare your skins. Combine both doughs and pull off small chunks and roll out into 3” circles about 1/8” thick.
11. Cover skins with a damp towel to keep them from drying out.
12. Once the ganache is solid, use a melon baller to scoop the ganache. Roll into balls and transfer to parchment lined plate. 
13. Let chill in the freezer for ten minutes to allow for easier wrapping.
14. Place the ganache balls on the wrapper and pinch pleat around the ball and seal at the top to close. Repeat until you are through with your ganache. 
15. Steam the XLBs. Bring a pot of water to a boil. Line your steamer with slotted parchment paper and place steam the XLBs for 5 minutes.

If someone taught me about kimchi as a little girl, my self-confidence would have come so much sooner. I of course grew to love the food very quickly, but was never quite confident to share it with friends in school because of the comments they’d make about it smelling weird, looking weird, etc. Fast forward many years later I’m rolling my eyes at it trending and popping up on every hipster restaurant’s menus. At the end of the day, I’m glad more people are getting to enjoy the foods I grew up loving.

These hand apple pies from @jasminepak are almost TOO cute to eat! Find the molds in our link in bio

Easy Hand Apple Pies
 - 2 lbs Trader Joe’s store-bought pie crust (feel free to make your own)
 - 3 Granny Smith Apples, thinly sliced and chopped
 - 3/4 tsp cinnamon
 - 4 tbsp unsalted butter
 - 1.5 tbsp flour
 - 1/8 cup water
 - 1/2 cup granulated sugar
 - 1 egg + 1 tbsp water for egg wash, sub milk wash
 - Extra sugar for topping
 - Optional: Apple pie mold
Directions:
1. Thaw your pie crust according to package instructions.
2. Preheat your oven to 425 F
3. Thinly slice apples and chop into smaller pieces. Set aside.
4. Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat.
5. Whisk in flour and simmer for 1 minute, continuing to whisk constantly.
6. Whisk in water and sugar and bring to a boil.
7. Once it comes to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer for another 2-3 minutes, whisking constantly.
8. Allow mixture to cool slightly and add over apples.
9. Toss until evenly coated.
10. Roll out the pie crust and press the mold into the crust to create the 2 outer layers. For the bottom layer, I avoided pressing the middle to leave the holes intact as to not lose any juice. I pressed the center of the mold with more force on the top layer to remove the holes.
11. Place the bottom layer onto the inside of the mold.
12. Add 2-3 tbsp of filling to the center.
13. Brush some egg wash onto the outer edges of the crust.
14. Carefully layer on the top crust and press the mold to crimp. 
15. Brush the top layer with egg wash and top with granulated sugar.
16. Bake the hand apple pies at 425 F for 12-14 minutes until golden brown.
17. Allow to cool slightly (the filling will be very hot!) and enjoy! 
18. Optional: Enjoy with ice cream! Makes 12-15 hand apple pies
@azulescoffee is one of my favorite new spots for drinks & desserts and I HAD to share it with y’all after stuffing my face with @visitanaheim 😋

It’s a 🌸Frida Kahlo🌼 themed cafe with Hispanic-inspired drinks, hand-crafted ice cream, churros, and moreeee!

I can’t stop thinking about the churro ice cream sandwich and the mazapan frappe 😍 

Everything was so delicious and creative and I love how involved they are in the community. 

Also, can we talk about the giant concha ice cream sandwich?!!? Amazing.

Let’s make a Sushi Bake with @jasminepak ! There are several ways to customize sushi bakes to your liking such as adding salmon, shrimp, scallops, and more! This time, we elevate it with some masago (fish roe), a great source of vitamin B12! Enjoy it as a meal or bring it to your next potluck! 

Quick & Easy Sushi Bake
3 cups cooked short grain rice
8 oz imitation crab meat
1/3 cup tablespoons Kewpie mayonnaise
1 ripe avocado (thinly sliced)
½ tbsp soy sauce
Furikake to taste (Japanese rice seasoning)
1 pack nori (roasted seaweed)
Sriracha (for topping)
Kewpie mayo (for topping)
1 pack of masago (fish roe)

1. Preheat oven to 375 F (190 C) and lightly grease your baking dish.
2. Shred your crab meat. I like to shred it with forks. Use one fork to hold the imitation crab down on one side and use the other fork to shred by using an outward pulling motion.
3. Cut the crab meat into smaller pieces to your liking.
4. Add 1/3 cup mayo to your imitation crab and mix until evenly coated. Set aside.
5. To your greased baking dish, add rice and smooth into an even layer.
6. Sprinkle on a layer of furikake followed by the thinly sliced avocado.
7. Add the imitation crab mixture on top and smooth into an even layer.
8. Bake for 10 minutes followed by broiling for 10 minutes until crab is golden brown.
9. Drizzle on some soy sauce. You can also omit and add/dip into soy sauce individually.
10. Sprinkle on another layer of furikake to taste.
11. Allow to cool slightly and top with a thin layer of masago.
12. Drizzle on kewpie and sriracha.
13. Scoop some onto individual plates and serve with nori.
How many wontons do you think you could eat in a single sitting? and why do I honestly think I could inhale 100? 😮‍💨

Directions:
1. Bring 3 cups of broth to a boil
2. Add in your bok choy and bring to a boil
3. Add in wontons and cook for 5 minutes.
4. While wontons are cooking, boil your noodles in a separate pot.

@jasminepak shows us how she makes Korean Steamed Egg, aka Gyeran Jjim (계란찜)! Find the recipe below!

Korean Steamed Egg, Gyeran Jjim (계란찜)
6 large eggs, beaten
1 cup chicken stock (sub vegetable stock, anchovy stock, or water)
1 tsp baking powder
2 tsp sesame oil
1 tbsp chopped green onion
Salt to taste

1. Add chicken stock to your stone/clay pot and bring to a boil over medium heat.
2. In a medium sized bowl, combine beaten eggs, baking powder, salt and combine until incorporated and smooth.
3. Once chicken stock comes to a boil, reduce the heat to low and slowly add the egg mixture while gently stirring. Make sure to scrape the sides of the pot to keep egg from burning.
4. Continue stirring until egg is about 75% cooked.
5. Cover with a bowl and let cook for an additional 3-4 minutes.
6. Carefully remove the bowl and top with sesame oil and chopped green onions. It is normal for the egg to deflate.

@leshrimpramen_usa is one of my favorite noodle spots and everyone needs to go try it 🦐😍

The flavors are so unique, so rich, and I love that you can customize your noodles between ramen, thick vermicelli, and rice noodles. Paired with the shrimp & chicken broth... ugh, chef's kiss. 

They also recently added a few vegan options to the menu, which are super flavorful and delicious. 

Tbh I come here quite often and always end up having to order both a soup noodle and dry noodle option. They're both so different and I always crave both flavors!!! I'M AN OPTIONS GAL

Also, not featured in the video but get the crispy chicken. You won't regret itttt!!!!! 

Here are my must-haves!
*Crispy Chicken
*Signature Trio Shrimp Ramen 
*Prawn with Chicken Wonton Tossed Ramen
*Vegan Ramen Soup with fried tofu, vegetable, and bamboo shoot

P.S. Le Shrimp just kicked off its new Happy Hour! Get 30% off any bowl of ramen from 2:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. Monday through Friday!!

Recipe below and on jasminepak.com ✨

Honey Walnut Shrimp
- 1 pound shrimp, Size 26-30
- 1/2 cup walnuts
- 2 tbsp honey
- toasted sesame seeds
- Oil for frying (vegetable, canola, grapeseed, or your choice)
- salt to taste

Sauce:
4 tbsp kewpie mayo
3 tbsp sweetened condensed milk
2 tsp lemon juice

Batter:
1/4 cup tbsp flour
1/4 cup tbsp corn starch
2 tsp baking powder
1 egg, beaten
1/2 cup water

Directions:
1. Prepare the sauce by mixing together the mayonnaise, condensed milk, and lemon juice. Set aside.
2. Make the batter. In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, cornstarch, baking powder, water, and eggs. Set aside.
3. Prepare your shrimp. I use frozen shrimp from costco. Defrost according to package instructions and pat dry. Toss with a dash of salt.
4. Heat oil in a skillet over medium high heat. I am opting for a shallow fry here.
5. Once hot, fry the walnuts for about 2 minutes until golden. 
6. Remove from heat onto a paper towel-lined plate.
7. Toss with honey and return to the skillet to fry for another 30 seconds. Remove and set aside.
8. Remove any honey bits from the oil and bring back up to heat. If your oil is filled with honey bits, use a new pan with new oil for a new shallow fry.
9. Prepare for dredging. Give your batter a mix as it has been set to the side for some time. 
10. Add the shrimp to the batter and toss to coat evenly.
11. Once oil is hot, fry the shrimp in batches on both sides until golden. About 1-2 minutes on each side.
12. Remove shrimp from the oil and transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.
13. When ready to eat, toss the shrimp with the sauce we made earlier until evenly coated.
14. Top with candied walnuts and toasted sesame seeds.

I asked y’all a while back on my stories what recipes you’d like to see more of and I got a lot of responses. One of the most popular requests was for chicken recipes! 

For those who requested more boyfriend and mom content, it’s comin’!

Without further ado, here is one of my favorite chicken recipes that is not only super flavorful, but also really easy to put together in less than 30 minutes.

Full recipe below and also on https://www.jasminepak.com/recipes/threecupchicken

Taiwanese Three Cup Chicken

Ingredients:
* 1-1.5 pounds of chicken drumsticks, cut (sub with thighs, wings, etc)
* 1/3 cup light soy sauce
* 1/3 cup Chinese cooking wine
* 1/3 cup toasted sesame oil
* 1-2 tbsp sugar (Or to taste. I use Monkfruit sweetener)
* 2 thin slices of fresh ginger
* 20 cloves garlic (or to taste)
* Large handful of Thai basil
* 1 tbsp baking soda (optional - no it’s not salty)

Directions:
1. Toss chicken with baking soda until evenly coated and let sit for 10 minutes.
2. Make the sauce. Combine soy sauce, cooking wine, toasted sesame oil, and sweetener and set aside.
3. Rinse baking soda off of the chicken and pat dry.
4. In a large pan over medium high heat, add ginger and garlic cloves. Toss until fragrant.
5. Add the chicken and brown on all sides. (This step is optional but I find that this helps keeps the chicken together)
6. Reduce the heat to medium low. Add in the sauce and make sure the chicken is evenly coated in the sauce. It's okay if the sauce doesn't fully cover the chicken.
7. Cover and cook for 10-15 minutes or until chicken is done cooking (internal temp 165 F)
8. Uncover and give your chicken a gentle toss. Add Thai basil to taste and toss. Cook for another 1 minute.
9. Serve with steamed rice and enjoy!
90 seconds sure feels long…

1 box soft tofu, thinly sliced
2 eggs, beaten and seasoned with a dash of garlic salt

Those garlic green beans you love from Din Tai Fung? It’s this!!!

Chinese Restaurant-Style Garlic Green Beans

- 3 cups green beans, trimmed and cut in half
- 5-10 cloves of garlic, minced (I used 10)
- Salt to taste (or 1/2 tsp)
- Oil for frying 
- Notes:
- Do not let oil dip below 350F or you will lose the wrinkling
- You can opt for a shallow fry and work in batches(I usually do this so I can use less oil)
- This recipe does not work in the air fryer. You may get wrinkling but the green beans will be tender instead of crunchy. 

Directions:
1. Add oil to a wok or pan and bring to 350F
2. Add green beans and flash fry for 30 seconds. 1 min if you want tender green beans
3. Remove green beans from oil and transfer to a paper towel-lined plate (or wire rack)
4. In a new pan, add 1 tbsp of oil and sauté minced garlic until fragrant. Turn off the heat.
5. Add back in the green beans as well as the salt.
6. Toss until evenly coated and enjoy!

Happy National Boba Day Everyone!!! 🧋🧋🧋
 
I hope you are celebrating with me and treating yourself to some delicious boba! 
 
I’m celebrating National Boba Day with Boba Bam, my newest favorite Costco find and DIY at-home boba drink! 
 
I’ve shared my love for @bobabamofficial on my stories before, and am excited to now be a #BobaBamAmbassador WOOO! 
 
I love that the boba is actually made in Taiwan because that QQ texture is super important for a happy boba experience. 
 
It takes like a minute to make — you just cut the pouch (you can microwave it in the pouch or pour it into a cup), microwave it for 60 seconds, add ice, milk, and enjoy! (stove-top directions also available!)
 
I’ve loved getting creative with different milk teas, fruit teas, slushies, but you can also use it as a topping like on shaved ice, dou hua, or even pancakes!
 
It’s really, really hard to find good at-home boba😭 I’ve tried soooo many and Boba Bam is by far the quickest solution to perfect boba. It’s so good it might as well have come from a boba shop!
 
Keep your eye out for the new packs that will come with paper straws! 🌱

Still thinking about this blind baking date night 😂❤️🌹

Lately I’ve been getting a lot of social anxiety when going out (bouncing back to “normal” still isn’t easy for me lol)… still trying to navigate that, but @george.nguyenz makes our at-home dates so much fun 🥹

 Also, this pie was SO freakin good. Highly recommend!

Samoa Pie Recipe from @averiesunshine

Ingredients
* 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted
* 1 large egg
* 1/2 cup light brown sugar, packed
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 1 1/4 cups flour
* 1/4 tsp salt, or to taste
* 3/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips, for sprinkling
* 1 1/2 cups sweetened shredded coconut, loosely laid in measuring cup (not packed)
* two-thirds of one 14-ounce can sweetened condensed milk (about 10 ounces)
* 4-5 oz salted caramel sauce
* 3/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips, melted for drizzling

Directions:
 1. Preheat oven to 350F. Spray a 9-inch pie dish very well with cooking spray; set aside.
 2. In a large bowl, melt the butter, about 1 min on high power.
 3. Wait before adding the egg so you don’t scramble it. Add egg, brown sugar, vanilla, and whisk until smooth.
 4. Add flour, salt, and stir until just combined.
 5. Turn batter out into prepared pie dish, smoothing the top lightly with a spatula. Bake for about 10-12 min or until edges firm up slightly and center will have begun to set up a bit.
 6. Remove pie dish from oven, and evenly sprinkle 3/4 cup chocolate chips over the crust.
 7. Evenly sprinkle the coconut.
 8. Evenly drizzle sweetened condensed milk.
 9. Evenly drizzle caramel sauce.
 10. Return pan to oven and bake for about 25 mins, or until there’s slightly bubbling near the edge of dish and the center has dried out some and looks more set. 
  11. Allow pie to cool in dish on a wire rack while you melt the chocolate for drizzling by adding chocolate chips to a small microwave-safe bowl and heat to melt, about 1 min on high power in 10-second increments.
 12. With a spoon, drizzle chocolate in long vertical lines spaced about 1/2-inch apart.
 13. Allow pie to continue to cool on wire rack for at least 4 hours (or overnight) before slicing and serving.

Beef Broccoli

2 Servings

Beef
- 1/2 lb flank steak, sliced 1/4-inch thick
- 1/4 tsp baking soda
- 1 tbsp water
- 1 tsp cornstarch 
- 1 tsp vegetable oil
- 1 tsp oyster sauce

Sauce
- 1/3 cup chicken stock
- 1 tbsp dark soy sauce (sub regular soy sauce)
- 1/2 tbsp oyster sauce
- 1 tsp sugar (I use Monkfruit Sweetener)
- 1/4 tsp sesame oil
- Dash of white pepper

And the rest!
- 2 cups broccoli florets
- 2 tbsp vegetable oil
- 1 tsp minced garlic (or 1-2 garlic cloves)
- 1/4 tsp ground ginger
- 1/2 tbsp Shaoxing wine
- 1 heaping tablespoon of cornstarch + 3 tbsp water

Directions:
1. In a medium sized bowl, add the sliced flank steak, baking soda, and water. 
2. Mix the beef and massage until all the liquid is absorbed. The baking soda helps to tenderize the meat. You can omit the baking soda if you don’t have it available.
3. Add cornstarch, oil, oyster sauce and mix well. Cover and marinate in the fridge for 30 minutes.
4. Blanch the broccoli. Add your broccoli florets into a pot of boiling water and cook for 20 seconds. If you like your broccoli softer, blanch for 30-60 seconds.
5. Remove the broccoli, dip in an ice bath, and set aside.
6. Make the sauce. Combine all the ingredients for the sauce and set aside.
7. Add oil to your pot over medium high heat. Once hot, cook your sliced beef on both sides until browned. Transfer the beef into another bowl and set aside.
8. Bring your pan back over medium heat and add oil. 
9. Add garlic and ground ginger and toss until fragrant. 
10. Add Shaoxing wine and the sauce mixture. Stir to incorporate all the browned beef bits around the pan and bring to a simmer.
11. Add the cornstarch slurry and stir constantly until well combined and slightly thickened, about 30 seconds.
12. Add the blanched broccoli and seared beef and mix until evenly coated.
13. Raise the heat and continue to cook for another 30 seconds. Remove from heat once the sauce is at your desired thickness. 
14. Enjoy with steamed rice.

Have you ever had a boysenberry?

My go-to garlic chopper!

Got a lot of questions on this device from my Garlic Shrimp recipe video and wanted to do a demo for y’all!

This is the Chef'n GarlicZoom Garlic Chopper. I do want to note that in the video I said it was the XL one, but it’s actually the One Size one. That being said, I have used it in the XL size and it works great, so you can’t go wrong with either.

I used to bulk mince my garlic at the start of each week with a food processor but I would always either always end up overindulging leaving me with a stomachache, orrrrr I’d have so much leftover and I’d end up wasting it. When it rains it pours! Also, something about freshly minced garlic just hits different. Holds that fresh garlicky spice, if you know what I mean?

Headed to LAX with my vax!! ✈️ #ad My world feels most colorful when I get to do things I love, like learning and experiencing different cultures through food and travel. 

All the small towns, big cities, hole-in-the-wall restaurants, and local favorites get me so excited to travel again. Getting vaccinated gives me a sense of peace knowing I’m not only helping protect myself, but also my friends, family, and communities.

You can do the same by heading to vaccines.gov to learn more! #WeCanDoThis

Much love ✈️🧳,

I’ve wanted to give this review for a while, but there’s a lot of pressure on ways to live the perfect zero waste lifestyle… and I got scared lol. But I got lots of DMs asking for an update on whether I like the Vitamix FoodCycler FC-50, so here it is!! 

I try to reduce waste where I can and this has become one of the most therapeutic parts of my day. On this journey, I learned that I just need a process that I can actually stick to.  I love being able to throw my food scraps in, press a button, and let the magic happen. TLDR, it is not cheap, but this works for me, my lifestyle, and I love that I can easily repurpose it at home with my plants.

BTW, @vitamix is having a huge holiday sale rn on items up to $125 off. This FoodCycler is $100 off! Here is the link (also in bio!): https://bit.ly/3lt3mMu

📍 @bluskyrestaurant | Anaheim, CA

#ad Cheesecake! Gingerbread cookies!! Two iconic and scrumptious holiday treats that make me believe the holidays are truly here.  
 I combined them together to make a super easy and delicious Gingerbread Cheesecake Cookie Cup and it was DELICIOUS. I used my McCormick spices to get the perfect flavors in this tasty holiday dessert.
  I dropped the link in my bio -- check it out and give it a try!
Sorry mom, we’re playing with our food! We headed to the Greek-inspired restaurant, @theialosangeles to check out their signature dessert, Moises’ Surprise where the chef comes out and creates art on your table with so many yummy desserts, and you get to eat it all!

This was such a fun and unique experience with friends, music, art, good vibes, and of course the delicious food! We scooped up all the toppings from the table and I regret nothing!!!
brunch with mama ❤️
At least I know how to open a pineapple if I find myself without utensils!!! 🍍🍍🍍
#ad Wishing I was back in paradise at #secretsloscabos 🏝 !!! Never have I ever been so relaxed with lots of different foods, sun-drenched beaches…and pure serenity. And it was all so easy to book at Beachbound.com 🧳
Fix my cheesecake with me! Full recipe in the works 💕 any flavor requests? 👀
#ad If you quadruple the amount of garlic in your recipes, we would get along <3

These garlic noodles are SO delicious, and you can customize the amount of everything to really fit your flavor palette! Switch out the pasta, add some spice, the world is your oyster! Speaking of oyster… Oyster sauce is the only thing you MUST keep in! For my veg friends, Mushroom sauce is the perfect substitute for oyster sauce. :) 

I grew up using @lkkusa sauces and they’ve been a huge part of my journey in cooking! They have tons of options to choose from and recipes on their website that can teach you new ways to use the sauces! Check out this link on the endless ways you can use oyster sauce! https://usa.lkk.com/en/cooking-stories/lee-kum-kee-oyster-sauces-the-ultimate-umami-boost-for-any-dish

RECIPE:

2 packs of udon noodles (or noodles of your choice! My other fav is spaghetti noodles)
2 tbsp butter
4 tbsp Lee Kum Kee Minced Garlic
2 large shiitake mushrooms, minced
1 tbsp Lee Kum Kee Oyster Sauce
1 tbsp soy sauce
1 tsp fish sauce
1/4 cup grated Parmesan or Pecorino cheese (or to taste)
2 scallions, thinly sliced
Optional: chili oil 

1. Boil your noodles until they’re about 70% cooked. Drain and set to the side. You can lightly cover them in some oil to keep them from sticking together into a huge block.
2. Melt butter over medium low heat then add in Lee Kum Kee’s minced garlic and toss until fragrant.
3. Add in your mushrooms, Lee Kum Kee oyster sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce, and mix until evenly combined.
4. Toss in your al dente noodles and mix well.
5. Add parmesan and scallions. Leave it as a topping or mix in — up to you!
6. Enjoy!

Couldn’t resist 😛🎃
Hot pot season is upon us!!! 🍲What are your make or break hot pot add-ins? 😍
Ok @george.nguyenz and I have since made up from the cookie scandal 🥰 we got some DIY Halloween house cookie decorating kits, binged the entire season of ‘YOU’ and ate lots of candy. I got all the candy corn to myself because he hates it. More for me I guess! 👻🎃💀
Ladies and gentlemen, here we have a classic case of losing TRUST!!! You can see here that I am eating a cookie. Look at how happy I am. Nothing else in the world matters in this moment because this cookie is deliciously chewy and rich. I take a bite and as my supposed ever-so-loving boyfriend comes in to take a bite, I am hesitant and I pull away. I don’t want to share my cookie… He chuckles gently. He seems harmless, so I decide to give him a chance and share my cookie with him so we can both partake in this deliciousness. To my utter dismay, he  BETRAYS me! How dare he! How can I ever trust again??!!!?? This is hands down top 10 anime betrayals of all time. We may need to seek out couples therapy. 🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩Thank you for reading my dramatic reenactment of George stealing my cookie 🥲🍪 treat yo self it’s a bones day!

What's your favorite instant noodle to slurp? @jasminepak can't make up her mind!
Phew, that ending save tho! 😭🙏🏼Here’s how to make traditional Korean dalgona candy aka honeycomb toffee (also called Ppopgi) that you saw in Squid Game 🦑

It only requires 2 ingredients: sugar and baking soda. The process is simple, but requires some technique. You melt the sugar, add a pinch of baking soda, flatten it, and press in your desired shape with a cookie cutter. 

A couple of helpful tips if you’re making this at home:
- Don’t melt the sugar on high heat. It will burn, making your candy extremely bitter and gross
- Refrain from adding too much baking soda. A pinch will do
- A lot of this recipe is about timing. If you are patient the first time around, this can take 5 minutes. If you rush it and burn the sugar, starting over costs you an additional 5-10 minutes. If you melt your sugar low and slow, you have a higher chance at success
- Lightly oil your baking mat or parchment paper. This will help with a smooth release.

If you’re making this at home, please take necessary precautions and be careful when working with hot sugar. Sugar burns are no joke!
This is so freaking yummy, I can’t stop eating it 😭 It tastes like a tropical vacation in your mouth 🏝

Maybe @george.nguyenz will show me some more of his fav Vietnamese dishes 😌
The cake we were supposed to recreate vs. the cake we recreated 😂 Can confirm that decorating a cake while being surprised with jump scares is a recipe for disaster, but we did it… kind of! Sorry for ditching you the first 5 times @oldladiekatie. Fight or flight got the best of me!! And thank you for being nice while judging our cake @kellympaige 👻🔪🎃 check out the full vid on @buzzfeedtasty!

Hello from the @buzzfeedtasty kitchen, it’s me and ya girl, @merleeshay ! 

Question of the day: Are you #TeamPancakes 🥞or #TeamWaffles? 🧇
📍Polar Playground | Huntington Beach 

These cotton candy characters are SO cute! We made the mistake of buying two of these…they are SO big! I was on my way to toss the rest of my cotton candy, but I felt bad for the food waste. Then a lady walked up to me and said “Oh my gosh, I can’t believe you’re going to eat that whole thing!” WELL, SHIT! I didn’t want to throw it away after she said that, so I proceeded to stuff the entire thing in my mouth and ate it until the very last bite. The characters were still very cute though, and I had a lovely date with the bae 😂
Someone once told me they didn’t care about food. They said it was too much work to chew and then it was over in five minutes. 😂 I had never heard something so unrelatable in my life… then proceeded to make a career out of food and eating lots of it. 😋 different strokes for different folks! 

I checked out @wisesons for some delicious Jewish comfort food and was not disappointed. Drizzling on that tangy mustard and biting into that deliciously moist and layered reuben had us reeling. So classic and satisfying. 

On his way out, a grandpa came over to tell us that we were in Jewish comfort food heaven and that he hoped we loved his culture’s cuisine. We did 🥰
This is the gigantic chirashi bowl that’s got me feelin’ some type of way! 🍣🍣🍣

I got this Monsta Box from @sooshme and there are ZERO REGRETS! 

Fish in my box:
💥 kelp-marinated fluke/ hirame (korea)
💥 yellowtail/ hamachi (japan)
💥 salmon/sake (faroe islands)
💥 bluefin tuna/ maguro (spain)
💥 wild snow crab/ zuwai gani (alaska)
💥 scallop/ hotate (hokkaido)
💥 dashi-marinated salmon roe/ ikura (alaska) 
💥 a5 miyazaki wagyu (japan)
💥 bluefin tuna belly/ otoro (spain)
💥 spot prawn/ botam ebi (canada) 
💥 eel/ unagi (japan) 
💥 octopus/ tako (greece)

The SAUCESSSSS:
Chili Garlic
Yuzu Kosho
Crispy Quinoa
Red Onion Aioli
Wasabi Salsa
+more

The platter was $298! Shared between 8 people, $37.25 per person for amazingly high quality delicious chirashi is a steal in my opinion!

Despite the calming music, these mfkers decided to deflate in less than 10 seconds after taking them out of the oven and then I screamed in my kitchen bc I missed my perfect shot 😂 

Anyway, here’s the recipe! 

French Cheese Soufflé

Ingredients:
1/2 stick butter +1 tbsp for greasing
1/2 cup flour

1. Preheat the oven to 350F
2. Grease your soufflé dish.
3. Melt the butter over low heat then remove from the heat. Whisk in the flour until butter is completely absorbed.
4. Return pan over heat and cook the mixture gently, gradually adding in milk, whisking constantly.
5. Separate the eggs. Take the pan off the heat and add the yolks in one by one making sure the first yolk is fully mixed in before adding the second.
6. Add the grated cheese & season with salt and pepper.
7. Using a hand mixer, beat the egg whites until you get stiff peaks.
8. Fold the egg whites into the mixture.
9. Pour the mixture into your soufflé dish about 3/4 full.
10. Bake for 20 minutes and do NOT open the oven. Don’t do it!
11. Once the soufflé has risen and turned a golden brown, enjoy! 
TIP: play with the recipe and add in your favorite ingredients like scallions, ham, cheese, & more!
Some OC Restaurant Gossip over here….. 💋Dumpling super fans might have heard about the Paradise Dynasty, a famous soup dumpling spot hailing from Singapore, has found its first US home in the same building as a Din Tai Fung location in South Coast Plaza (Costa Mesa)

Apparently, there’s no competition in Asia, and people will eat at Din Tai Fung one day, and Paradise Dynasty the next day! They are simply different. 

For context, South Coast Plaza is a high-end mall with popular shops and luxury brands. They are the highest earning mall in the nation, raking in an insane $2 BILLION+ in revenue every year. 

Lines are often out the door at Din Tai Fung with long wait times. Paradise Dynasty just opened up and from my experience, people were lined up before opening hours and some waited over 2 hours before being seated. Luckily, this is no real hassle since you can just go into the mall to shop or walk around. I don’t see lines for either Din Tai Fung or Paradise Dynasty shortening - just more dumpling-hungry people 😂🥟 

Do you have a favorite soup dumpling spot?

#ad Behold... this behemoth of a burger.  I like my burgers big, flavorful, super juicy and this baby is just that! Even though I’m a big meat-eater, you all know how much I also love incorporating plant-based foods into my diet. I’ve found so many ways to whip up a tasty meal and this burger is no different. 

Here I’m using a 100% plant-based burger from @incogmeatous, stacking it on a Hawaiian bun, white onion, a fat slice of tomato, a mushroom cap, grilled pineapple, lettuce, banana peppers, and Japanese mayonnaise for some extra sweetness. It’s freakin’ amazing! What goes into your perfect burger? #incogmeato

Ya girl is in TEARS! #ad I'm partnering up with @target (loml ❤️) to show you how to make a dorm-friendly Chia Seed Pudding. Wooo!

No joke, in high school, my friends would meet up at Target to literally hang out and walk around the store - it was always the best time. Kind of feels weird to write out, but I have no shame!!! It was so fun.

I remember making multiple trips to Target before going to college to make sure I was ready for move-in day. They had the coolest finds, everything I needed to live comfortably in a new place, AND I moved in stocked up on all the best dorm-friendly snacks. (It's a good way to make friends!!! 😉)

Come to Disneyland with me and my boyfriend! (& see what we ate of course) 😋

Disneyland has such a special place in my heart. I performed at Disneyland every year in middle school/high school with my school orchestra. (If you’re seeing this and we went to school together, hi! Hope you’re doing well! ☺️) We’d get to rehearse in the back lots, perform, then enjoy the parks after our performance. It was an awesome time to be creative, play music, make art, and spend time with your best friends. 

I still remember the last experience playing there. That was almost 8 years ago at this point. I didn’t even realize how special these special these moments were back then. Fast forward to today, I miss those moments dearly. Now when I go to Disneyland, I still freaking love it. My fondness for the Disney parks is painted by those vibrant memories I made when I was younger and now, it still serves as a place that inspires me and brings me so much happiness. I don’t care what anyone says DISNEY MAGIC IS REAL 😭✨

Cookie #13 from The Cookie Cookbook I got when I was a kid. Malted Milk Cookies.

It’s been a while since I’ve made a cookie for this series. If I’m honest, it’s been a love/hate relationship. I filmed this recipe over 2 months ago and never found it in me to want to edit it. I started this series when my mom had brought the book over to me the week I moved in to my new home. She asked “Remember this book?” She had the biggest smile on her face. She knew I’d remember. I got this book when I was 12 at B&N at the bargain section and said “I’m gonna make all of these when I have my own kitchen.” 

I began my cookie journey and was so grateful to those who joined me. I planned to finish all the recipes within a few months, which became several months.. and I’m still not through it. 

I got lost somewhere along the way. It was no longer a creative outlet that brought me happiness. You know how it is. Can you imagine not wanting to bake cookies?! Wild. 

So many thoughts, but my point is that balance is everything. In recipes, too much of one ingredient can throw the whole dish array. Life isn’t too different. Balance is important and sometimes it’s hard to detect those imbalances if you’re going so fast to the point where you’re just running through the motions. I took a break to rediscover that same excitement I had for this cookie journey at the very beginning…. And now it’s back :) 

Put on your stretchy pants, it’s cookie time!

🍓🍌🍫The versatility of roti is seriously just endless. I was craving something sweet and indulgent, and threw together this delectable Strawberry Banana & Chocolate Roti Roll-up. 

I put everything together in 5 minutes and devoured it in 5 seconds.

Sprinkling the cinnamon sugar onto the roti made it taste just like a churro, without the hassle and mess of making homemade churros! 1000% making this again. So yummy!

Pesto eggs but with ROTI! Obviously, roti is delicious by itself, but I also love using it as a wrap. It adds that extra depth of butteriness and flakiness that's finger lickin’ good. 
 
I tried it with the ever-so-viral TikTok pesto eggs and it was AMAZING. I had to make another one because George wouldn’t stop trying to eat mine.
 
I used Roti from #SynearFoods which I got from @99ranchmarket ! 
 
I got a dessert roti recipe coming your way tomorrow ;)

RENO TAHOE IS SO UNDERRATED! #ad I did a lil solo trip with @renotahoe and fell in love with The Biggest Little City in the World! It’s got something for every traveler and I wanted to share my itinerary with you!

#1: Biggest Little City in the World - I started off my morning by the iconic arch in downtown Reno. I mean... did you really go to Reno if you didn't take a picture with the arch? 😂

#2: ☀️Morning Hike on the Tom Cooke Trail - I love exploring nature when traveling and this hike was the perfect way to soak in the sights: bright blue skies, the wide open desert, and the flowing Truckee River.

#3: 🌳Bicentennial Park - The Riverwalk District in downtown Reno has so much art to explore. Also, I saw a local man painting the scene along the river at the park and the Bob Ross vibes were simply immaculate.

#4: 🍷Whispering Vine - After some sun, I went to happy hour because, well, wine not? They had so many options to choose from and was the perfect pitstop before a meal.

#5: 🥘 Centro - FOOOOOD. YOU HAVE TO GO TO CENTRO. I had the most tender beef tataki topped with miso aioli, smoked eggplant puree, pickled enoki mushrooms, shiso, and orange chili sauce. I literally still remember everything in it because I dream about it to this day.
@sooshme was my happy little secret for a while and now I’m sharing it with you all 👀🍣 

This is the same spot Viola Davis, Mindy Kaling, Ellen Pompeo, Popeye the Foodie, and other celebs get their omakase sushi boxes from so obviously it’s frickin amazing

You DM @sooshme to place your order. The boxes are also customizable so if you have a salmon bias like me, world is your oyster 😋

can I blame the pandemic for being bad at flip cup now? 🥲
Crispy Korean Chive Pancakes Buchujeon (부추전)! I love this dish. You can have it as a side, as your whole meal, a snack.. anytime is the right time for chive pancakes. I can never decide on what texture and thickness is my favorite, so I make some thinner, some thicker, some crispier, all for some variety. Hope you like it!

Ingredients:
½ pound chives (3.5 cup after slicing into 2-inch pieces and packing tightly)
¾ cup AP flour
¾ cup corn starch
1 cup water
1 egg
1 tsp salt

Sauce:
2 tbsp soy sauce
1 tbsp rice vinegar
1/2 tsp sugar or to taste

Directions:
1. Combine the flour, corn starch, water, egg, and salt. Combine until batter is smooth.
2. Add in your prepped chives and mix until all the chives are covered in batter. You’ll know your ratio is good if the batter doesn’t pool. (It should look like a chive-heavy batter)
3. Scoop your chive pancake batter onto a cast iron skillet or nonstick skillet and fry until about 3/4 of the way through. Once it begins to move around the pan in a single unit, you can flip it. One side will look more batter heavy. This is normal. Fry until crispy or golden brown.
4. Make the sauce. Combine soy sauce, rice vinegar, sugar, and mix well.
5. Slice your chive pancakes, dip them in your sauce, and enjoy! #buchujeon #chivepancake #koreanrecipe

i did 𝓃𝑜𝓉 get my driver’s license last week 🎶
I distinctly remember the shift in (semi)acceptance for kimchi. I remember bringing kimchi dishes to school and hearing other kids tell me that it smelled disgusting. I remember telling my mom to stop packing me specific foods as a little girl because I didn’t want to spend my entire lunch getting strange looks or explaining how I could eat “such a thing.” I remember feeling so much shame for loving foods that are so near and dear to my culture and identity. Then I remembered kimchi becoming “cool” and “funky” and “trendy.” Sheesh, it pissed me off ngl. It popped up all over brunch menus in LA and people posting about their avocado toast topped with a poached egg and some kimchi. It was no longer a “disgusting smelly Asian veggie” and instead a “healthy and fermented vegetable filled with probiotics.” As I got older, I learned to surround myself with accepting people and I’m so lucky to have my friends, my coworkers, and YOU all who CELEBRATE my Asian culture and identity. I know it’s been an echo chamber of thoughts surrounding anti-Asian hate, but I implore you to check on your Asian friends and family. Ask them if they need a walking buddy, a ride home, open ears to vent to. If you’re able to, donate, support your local Asian-owned businesses, broaden your circle, your content consumption, and deepen your knowledge surrounding our history and struggles. Be an active ally. 

With that being said, here’s a story someone once told me when I was a little girl about how Kimchi Pancakes became a rainy day food in Korea. It stuck with me growing up and I’d love to share it with you all as well. 

Kimchi Pancakes
-1 cup roughly chopped kimchi
-1 cup kimchi juice
-1 green onion
-1 tsp sugar
-1 cup flour

Dipping sauce:
-1 tbsp soy sauce
-1 tbsp water
-2 tsp rice vinegar
-1 tsp sugar

Directions:
1. Combine the chopped kimchi, kimchi juice, green onion, sugar, and flour and mix until well combined.
2. Add oil to coat the bottom of a nonstick skillet or cast iron pan over medium heat. Do not use high heat as it will burn easily.
3. Pour batter and spread evenly over the pan.
4. Cook until the bottom is golden brown and flip. Repeat. Add more oil if you need it

#ad When I’m having a busy day of filming, I love to be able to have a quick bite to eat without sacrificing flavor. Frank’s Boneless Chicken Bites are not only delicious, but super easy to toss in the oven, microwave, or air fryer to get that perfectly crisp bite. Get creative with it! Turn it into a spicy chicken sandwich, toss it over some salad, or even a baked buffalo chicken Mac n cheese! @franksredhot

It’s the Year Of The Ox! How is everyone celebrating Lunar New Year this year? 🧧I might remake these cow-shaped baos I made a few months back! 🐮 #YearOfTheOx #lunarnewyear
Lunar New Year is approaching this Friday and I wanted to share a traditional Korean dish you might like to try so we can all celebrate together! 🧧

Japchae is a popular side dish and is a glass noodle stir fry.

If you go to any family event, I assure you that a huge foil tray filled with japchae will be there. 

It’s yet another dish that every family makes differently. Some like it lighter, and as you might have guessed, I like it heavier. 

This dish always makes me think of my aunties gossiping in the kitchen. Each one has a different role. One is prepping all the ingredients, one is cooking everything, and of course the last auntie is the one with her gloves on mixing up the japchae like it’s an olympic sport. This vision makes me happy. 

Japchae
-10 oz sweet potato noodles 
-1/2 lb beef, sliced into small strips
-7 shiitake mushrooms
- Slice thinly
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 2 tsp sugar
- 2 tsp soy sauce
- 2 tsp sesame oil

-1 large handful spinach - blanched
- 1 tsp soy sauce
- 1 tsp sesame oil

-1 yellow onion
-1/2 cup shredded carrots (or 1-2 carrots)
-3 green onions

Sauce (Adjust to taste!)
-4 tbsp soy sauce
-1 tbsp sesame oil
-sugar to taste (or 1 tbsp)
-1 tsp minced garlic
-½  tsp black pepper
-1 tbsp toasted sesame seeds

I recently opened up to my mom about the state of my mental health. I used to really hate talking about mental health and it doesn’t help that it’s not necessarily the easiest topic for Asian households — at least mine. I was hesitant to bring it up, scared even? I wasn’t really scared about how my mom would react, it was just unfamiliar territory… but as soon I started to open up, it all started to flow out and I was met with acceptance and reciprocation. I feel so lucky to be able to have these candid conversations with my mom and my family that it’s hard to put into words. I’m even having trouble writing this, haha. Anyway… I just wanted to share this moment with everyone and remind you all that your feelings are valid. It’s okay to not be okay. It’s okay to do things for yourself and take time for yourself. It’s okay to say no. You can only be the best version of yourself when you take care of yourself, and there is no shame in that. Sending everyone lots of love <3 - jasmine
Blue Thai Tea Cheesecake. My mom was a huge fan of this one and Asian moms are hard to please, let me just tell ya! 

Adapted recipe, original recipe by @thegastronomygal 

Ingredients:
Crust:
-¾ cup. graham cracker crumbs
-1 tbsp granulated sugar
-2 1/2 tbsp. unsalted butter, melted 
Filling:
-1 cup full-fat cream cheese, softened to room temperature
-¼ cup granulated sugar
-1 tsp lemon juice
-½ tsp vanilla extract
-3/4 cup plain whole milk Greek yogurt
-2 eggs -3 tbsp Blue Thai Tea leaves (ground) - I use La Moon tea - Blue Thai Tea

Directions (copy pasted from thegastronomygal w/ small changes):
1. To make the crust, combine graham cracker crumbs and sugar. Add in melted butter and stir until combined. Press the mixture onto the bottom of the pan and bake at 375F for 10 min. Remove and allow to cool. Wrap 2 layers of foil around the bottom of the baking pan.
2. In a medium bowl, add cream cheese and use an electric whisk to cream for 4 min or until lumps are removed
3. Add in sugar, lemon juice, vanilla extract, and Greek yogurt. Whisk until just combined. Do not over mix. Add in the eggs and whisk until combined
4. Remove 1/4 of the batter and pour into a separate bowl.
5. Add the blue Thai tea powder to the bowl with more batter and whisk until batter is completely blue. Add more blue thai tea powder if you like stronger tea flavors
6. Chill for 30 minutes. This will help create an even separation between the blue and white batter.
7. Pour the blue batter into the pan over the crust. Shake pan to smooth the batter out. Add the plain batter over the top by using a ladle.
8. Place the cheesecake pan into a larger pan that is at least 1.5″ high and add boiling water to the larger pan to create a water bath. The water should be about 1 in high and shouldn’t leak into the foil. Bake cheesecake for 55-60 min at 325F
9. Once cheesecake is baked, crack the oven door a bit and allow cheesecake to cool in the oven for 1 hour. Remove cheesecake from the water bath and refrigerate for at least 5 hours
10. Dust the cheesecake with some additional butterfly pea Thai tea powder and enjoy!  Check out her video on Youtube for a step-by-step tutorial @thegastronomygal!
Some of my favorite moments from my last trip to Taiwan:
 
12.27.18 @8:30am  Jhongshan District 
Landed in Taipei. First thing we did was go to 7-Eleven to raid all the cool drinks because their 7-Elevens are wild. I got bottled milk tea and some salted egg yolk chips. 
 
12.27.18 @12:04pm  Songshan District 
Met up with my aunt and cousins after they got out of class and went to town on these steaming xiao long baos. Burned my mouth. Just the way I like it lol
 
12.28.18 @1:37pm  Jiufen
My grandma smiling while spending a whole day out with her grandkids. She's so cute.
 
12.29.18 @5:31pm  Taipei 101
Got to see the whole city from up top. It's a distant memory now, but I remember feeling so carefree.
 
12.31.18 @11.33pm  Xinyi District
This is the video I watch when I need a pick-me-up. It was New Years Eve. We waited outside Taipei 101 making jokes, listening to live performances, and drinking boba and eating popcorn chicken. Best freaking night of my life. 
 
I miss these moments. I miss the raw, meaningful, unforgettable moments you experience while traveling. I'm so happy Taiwan was able to handle Covid so well, because that means so many small businesses, hard-working families, and kind locals were able to continue living their day-to-day lives. I can't wait to see you again, Taiwan! Already planning for my next #EscapeToTaiwan. Check out the link in my bio to see how you can plan your future trip, too!

#ad Currently thinking about this little cake shop I stumbled upon in Taipei in Da-an District on my last trip to Taiwan. Yeah, these are cakes 😱I can't remember the name of the cafe, but I remember spending 20 minutes picking out which one before going with the chirashi bowl... which was actually a lovely vanilla cake with pear jelly and soft candy. Video at the end for an inside scoop - literally!

Spontaneously finding unique cafes in Taiwan was one of my favorite things about my trip and I can't wait to relive it on my next #escapetotaiwan. Check out the link in my bio to start planning your trip for when it’s safe to travel again! #cbs #taiwantourismbureau
I never thought I’d find boba mochi at Costco 😱🧋 #costcofinds #bobamochi

Some exciting news I’ve been wanting to share with y’all for months!!! 🥰

I’m the host of a new travel show with CBS and the Taiwan Tourism Board called Escape to Taiwan!

This is just a little preview of it, but it’s been such a pleasure being part of this campaign and I can’t wait for you all to check it out! I’m ready to relive my travels to Taiwan and all the memories of walking through crowded night markets, easily maneuvering the streets like a local, meeting the nicest locals ever, and of course all the gorgeous nature the island has to offer.

It’s amazing how well Taiwan handled the pandemic and once we’re able to travel again, you better bet I’ll be on the first flight back to Taiwan. My wanderlust is out of control and I’ve already started making an itinerary! Check out the link in my bio to see how you can start planning your escape to Taiwan! ✈️🇹🇼

P.S. My first ever internship was at CBS and so this project has a very special place in my heart. It’s so awesome getting to work with the CBS family again, but this time as your friendly Food & Travel expert. <3 Thank you all for your continued support and cheers to making more memories post-pandemic! #escapetotaiwan

Was about to share cookie #5 with y’all until I realized I haven’t even posted 3&4 🥴 

basic oatmeal cookies recipe

2 cups uncooked old-fashioned oats
1½ cups all-purpose flour
¾ teaspoon baking soda
½ teaspoon baking powder
½ teaspoon salt
1 cup packed brown sugar
¾ cup (1½ sticks) butter, softened
¼ cup granulated sugar
1 tablespoon honey
1 teaspoon vanilla

Add egg, honey and vanilla; beat at medium speed until well blended. Gradually add flour mixture, about ½ cup at a time. Do not overmix dough or it will become too soft.

This is my favorite way to make Korean Spicy Cucumber Salad 🥒! It’s one of those banchans where everyone has their own way to make it. It differs from restaurant to restaurant and family to family! It’s always the first one I try when I go to a new Korean restaurant because it tells me a lot about how the rest of their menu will taste like. When I can tell they let it marinate overnight, I know that they love stronger flavors like I do and everything is more pickled, more savory, more spicy, and it gives me that comfort of traditional Korean home cooking 🥰

Ingredients:
-8 Persian Cucumbers, washed
-1/2 cup green onions, chopped
-2 tbsp garlic, minced
-1.5 tbsp white vinegar
-2 tbsp soy sauce
-2 tbsp sesame oil
-1 tbsp Korean chili flakes (gochugaru)
-1 tbsp sesame seeds
-2 tsp sugar

Directions:
1. Cut your cucumbers about 1/3 inch thick 🥒 
2. Roughly pat dry then toss with salt and let it sit for 15 minutes. This will help drain excess water in the cucumbers so they maintain that crunch.
3. Rinse with water and pat dry again.
4. Transfer to a large bowl or container.
5. Toss in the remaining ingredients. Adjust to your own taste!
6. Serve immediately or fridge overnight.  Good for up to a week or so!

Raise your hand if you remember inhaling Lychee Coconut Jellies as a kid 🙋🏻‍♀️I got a couple more favorites to add to the list: Passion Fruit & their new Yogurt flavor! They're sooo juicy and flavorful, it's like my favorite childhood flavors in little cups. I'm obsessed with them!!! Pro Tip: Save the cups and reuse them for when you make jello shots! As a kid, I would glue the cups together and make a jewelry holder and my grandparents would braid the jelly stick wrappers into coasters.

Hi friends! As you know, I’m a travel producer and I miss traveling 😭 I miss every step of it — hopping on a plane, eating plane snacks, and then eating more food upon landing. My trip before COVID would have been to Taiwan (again, hehe) and it would have started on a China Airlines flight with those delicious and addicting rice crackers. 

Well good news, they now carry these rice crackers at Costco in the U.S. and in Taiwan! Fun fact - TRYGOODZ has been a best-selling, fan favorite in Taiwan for 3 decades, but plenty people don’t know that those yummy rice crackers are made for airplanes and other companies as well! I’m talking China Airlines, Eva Air, Lexus, Toyota, and more! You might have snacked on these without even knowing it!

The rice crackers are lacto vegan and include a variety of mixed nuts, green peas, rice puffs, seaweed crackers, and more! Also, there are no evil surprise wasabi peas so they score points with me for that haha. Here’s me holding a box of the TRYGOODZ rice crackers that you can get for yourself! #ad #trygoodz 

Please appreciate that I went to Costco an hour before it opened so I could get this picture without a mask in an empty lot lol

I’ve loved food and travel for as long as I can remember, so being able to produce content about it is certainly a dream come true! I was always a creative little girl, but I really only got to express that side of me during after-school programs. They were incredibly important in shaping me into the producer I am today. I partook in art programs and music programs, which ended up being the highlights of my day. Census data informs funding for educational programs important to all of our communities.  I can’t imagine a life without art and creativity — especially for the young ones in school today! Complete the #2020Census so our passions and communities are accurately represented!

I'm 21!!! 🎉Thank you to everyone who made this chaotic week something truly... memorable. After a poisonous Brown Recluse spider bite, a horrid eye infection, and multiple urgent care visits, I'm happy to say I'm all drugged up and going to be alright 👌🏻 I didn't have a traditional turning 21 celebration, but I sure do have an interesting story to tell. #nyclife #twentyone #birthdaygirl #spiderwoman #nodrinking
