“they always dreamed of being magical creatures in another world, wanting an escape from their own bodies. so they made their creatures together as a promise, a soul-binding process that left them longing for each other.”
@comfycatboy is you,, but uraraka 🥺💕
some friends :) (the last two weren’t from my thing, i just wanted to add them bc they’re cute :))) comfy n cozy)
their pronouns bc they’re new: they/them, he/she/they, it/he, he/him :))

pride 🏳️‍🌈💕
the line art turned out fucky for this so i just colored the sketch but hhhh hi i’m gay surprise who knew
CW: death is mentioned 
Iridium 
him -> before death -> “human” form for earth visits (often mistaken for a cosplayer) -> a lil somethin else 
finally made good- ish refs for the boys !! not colored but thats okay
CW: death is mentioned 
Osmium (Ozzy)
him -> before death -> “human” form for earth visits (often mistaken for a cosplayer)

Emile 🥺💕
a quick snail to try out my new tablet,, it is so much more fun using a pen than my fingers hdndjdn
there are several things i should be working on rn but hehe ushiten sticker designs that will probably never be made into actual stickers
part 2/2 of the lps as humans art collab!!!
@one_strange_child drew these ones :33 they came out so good!
perks of having a floating head~
redraw of one of my old doodles,, i don’t feel like finding the old one but, just trust jjsbjsj

i honestly forget how fun mirrored drawing is
it’s always the men with the masks,, 
i’ve wanted to draw frank n mr. sniper since I finished high rise invasion, I like how it came out!!
tried somethin funny with the shading,, kinda like that too.
part one,,, my part of an art collab!!! the second part will be posted here soon enough.
a few of my favorite lps as humans!!
a quick langa ,, ft flustered reki 😌
a few doodles from today :)) i was too proud of the yuri to not make a post 
the deku was kind of a fail but he still deserves love :,))
i took some inspiration from @cococrackerz ‘s dtiys ((which you should totally do if you haven’t already)) and did an Ushijima in the same kinda way :))
also i haven’t done a time lapse in a bit so i did this one and my entry 💕
#coco7k !!!
hands and me do not mix so i had to improvise, but this was so fun aaa he’s so cute! 
@cococrackerz i hope you like him 💕💕
a few song oc things, the color ones are at the end bc i like the sketches more oops.
the songs go gender/style/personality/colors
i wanted to do a few of my favorite playlists on spotify.
this is the physical proof that my “style” is fuck all,,
anyway
they’re boyfriends
we'll call this the Valentine's post instead 💕
I wanted to try out a new app I found, I like how it came out :)) also my hair's gettin long,,
⚠️mentions of suicide and death⚠️
a bit about iridium and his little brother ozzy 💕
a lot of reading but i hope you find it interesting :,,)
2nd character on 2nd slide belongs to @ketchup__water :)))
also lmk if you can’t read anything my handwriting as atrocious
⚠️CW!! : implied drug use
POV: you’re “just chillin” with your best friend and then his gay uncle is coming to bother you guys bc of boy problems and your best friend tells you to “act normal” but “how the fuck am i to act normal rn” so you just avoid eye contact when he asks why it’s so smokey in the room.
aka: iridium and jason are smokin and julius is a gay mess
😊
the bbys bc i haven’t drawn them in a bit, then some other losers idk (i LOVE THEM HSHVD)
charlie 😌 3/3
charlie, 2/3
charlie,, 1/3 (ignore JSJSH)
“how do i look, Wakatoshi-kun?”
a little Tendou reminiscing 💕
lomllomllomllomllomllomllomllo-
doodles and unfinished digital sheet.
ALSO @ketchup__water i did draw your child but i couldn’t get their hair right 😡😡
i recently found someone that draws bakugo with braces and i cannot get it out of my head.
merry christmas :)
happy holidays :))
and if you don’t celebrate nothin’ then just have a good day. 💕
they are,, christmas colors 🥺
if you haven’t noticed ushiten is my comfort ship atm and no one can take that away from me.
bbys
also: a concept for Iridium. not canon but 👀👀
also also: normalize masculine bitches in dresses okay.
half shitpost but hey, look at me trying to do basic anatomy. just don’t look at the hand. 🙃
sorry Tom i used Gerald as a puppet for practice he’s just too good 😔👌
HI 
the second and third slide is me updating my hair on my drawn self but itS REALLY FUN TO DRAW ITS SO FLUFFY-
but yea doodles :)
back on the ✨bullshit✨
the last of the inktober prompts!!
this was really fun, i got lazy throughout the entirety of it but it still got me drawing something every day witch was good!!
happy halloween !!! 🎃💀💕
#inktober2020 #inktober
week 3.
got lazy w this one lol.
#inktober2020 #inktober
week two here we go.
i very much enjoy drawing teeth :)
week one of inktober!!
I like day 7 the best 💕#inktober2020 #inktober
i wanted to play with a highlighter and draw feral Keith bc I’m rewatching Voltron and i MISS him.
also: a baby Zak 🥺🥺
thinkin’ ‘bout Clancy,,, 
he is so fun to draw, i like his color scheme for some reason.
they,,, are friends,, 🥺
@ketchup__water
*music box tiny light plays in the bg*
this iridium with this choker 😌💕
he has quite the choker collection.
I’m too lazy to draw his full body rn but i promise he has legs n arms n shit.
not even an hour into my senior year and we’re already back on the bullshit ✌️
he 💕
AAAAAA these are messy but school starts tomorrow and i :,,,)
i’m stressed.
side note my hair has grown lot since i last dyed it so it’s v brown.
Ota and Yuma say to wear your mask! 
this was mostly to make changes to their merged form but it has a good ✨message ✨
i had to lmao.
also! the last slide is what they have to use for masks, bc their ears are too big for the straps.
my dad and i found self laminating thingies at the dollar store so i used some doodles to try them out 💕
they on my ugly ass walls now uwu
some doodles from the past month or so~
the last one was the “draw your oc in the clothes you’re wearing” thing that i did a while ago. 💕💕
i like to use the tops of tissue boxes for frames 💕
don’t look at my tan walls i hate them
hehe remember when i said James’s eyes glow in the dark? yeAh
nobody: 
Ota: *radio rebel face*
⚠️(they’re both over 18)
thinkin’ ‘bout the boyfriends from butter lover 👊🥺
IGNORE the fact that i forgot mullet homeboys eyebrow piercing thanks.
me: *comes back after a week and a half with yet another new art style* hey.
Kambe Daisuke with his hair down while in Haru’s clothes somehow cured my art block and momentarily my depression that’s not relevant to this post i just love him.
DID I DO IT RIGHT @tomayo_naisse 
#tomayo_harry
redesigned JuJu a bit, and a hidey Orville. 🥺💕🥺
J: 6’5 (not including ears/horns)
O: 5’7
overall height difference: 10 inches oops he’s on his tippy toes-
here we have s h ! t pos t.
unfinished or messy things that have never seen the light of day 👊😔.
the last two were done last year but i like them so shut up.
#lily_art_centre !!
this was super fun!! i regret not using a reference but i hope you like it @_little_pluto12 !!!! uwu.
he :).
a new friend!
you know those people with overly sexual sounding sneezes? Ota is those people.
happy 69th post uwu
his hair is,, hard.
i realized that i have never drawn him *shrugs* here’s dat boi.
well SOMEBODY has been practicing his angy face in the mirror! Yu can get a little mad,, as a treat.
fr tho Yuma is almost never mad and if he is you should probably run. Ota knows this. 
and yes, their ears go down when scared or sad because i said so.
i did a little plagg re-design last year and made it into a badge (as shown in the second slide,) and wanted to draw him again!
this is one of those instances where i ended up liking the line art better than the actual finished thing but i still love him uwu.
another Ota 💕
i swear i love Yuma too i just have a thing for crazy bastards 😭😭
Iridium and his “human” form. When they visit the human realm everyone likes to ask him one of two things: if he’s a cosplayer or a furry. 
he just needs to smile and nod through the pain.
derpy pets uwu.
if you couldn’t tell, i can’t draw dogs for shit. 
(facts no one asked for:
the cats are all just regular shorthairs, first dog is a chihuahua terrier and the last one is a lab pit 😌)
yes, they are all my pets.
bird vs one taily boi, who would win?
no matter where they are, what they’re doing (👀) Leif is always shipping, silently...
they have arrived. 
i ordered these last month and they finally came! i wasn’t gonna put drawings but this is technically an art acc so i rushed through them 🙃.
also i don’t have any of the haikyuu manga but what i do have is a doujin that was found at goodwill that is in Japanese so i can’t properly read it. ✌️
(Yato from Noragami and Kageyama from Haikyuu 🥰)
also! the cute anime girl holding the candle is the company card! i thought it was super cute. 💕
this is Zak. 
they.
idk, some babes. 😌
i’m love him 💕💕
i wanted to color that one Carter because i thought it was cool oops.
i swear my sketches keep getting more and more derpy, don’t pay attention to the blue sketch 😂😂
rambunctious little fucktard. 
this is carter, his tooth got knocked out. he likes picking fights. (second and third ones are him as a kid, the third one was done last year, the first version of him)
pink and yellow is one of my favorite color combinations so i wanted to do smthn with that, i wasn’t prepared to fall in love.
they need a name, any suggestions?
also idk if i like the white or colored hair better :/
honestly the only source of serotonin i’m receiving rn except for fictional characters is drawing myself how i wish i looked.
the only thing super different is the lip piercing, cartilage piercing, and the glasses but it still makes me happy.
part 5?
*bad recorder version of my heart will go on plays in the distance*
gross.
they’re best friends, but the twins don’t need to know that,, yet,,,
there’s always one gay twin whoops.
pt 4
my brain was some type of fucked up today so here are some cursed class doodles.
meet the Maji twins! 
they’re the same ones as a few posts back, they just didn’t have a story until now.
never thought i’d have bnha OC’s but here we are.
the last one is them fully merged together.
pt 3
you’re gonna be getting at least one of these every day to every couple of days so have fun with them i guess.
pt2
messy~ messy~ messy~
i’m currently I’m the midst of a 2-week college class. only three days in and my brain can’t form anything coherent. lots of messy doodles from class tho -w-
my handwriting is atrocious i am so sorry.
pt1
d o o d l e. d u m p. ✌️
he looks like a bootleg haikyuu character lmao.
a secret about me is that i have absolutely no idea how to draw clothes so i just bullshit my way through it so here aren’t so many shirtless boys in my feed.
idk man i’m just vibin.
noya san noya san noya sannn 💕
my favorite thing to do is draw expressions that are so exaggerated that they’re never possible irl.
(Nishinoya from Haikyuu!!)
i realized that i can put the process in a video and i’m mesmerized by it.
i’ve posted this character before, a bit further down but he had blue hair and no glasses, he dyes his hair a lot...
(that’s why no one really notices him,,,)
this how i be feelin lately ✌️
this was rushed because i literally forgot that it was June 1st but happy pride month!! 💕🏳️‍🌈
round two!! my girls as humans this time 💕
fuck it, personified pets.
he dyes his hair AND his feathers? what a rebel.
they’re boyfriends.
i can’t draw,,, bodies??
honestly? i draw random people more than i draw my ocs.
random 👏 shiet 👏
i’ve been wanting to redesign my first oc Jason for a while, so here he is!
the last picture is the first one i had ever drawn of him and it make me want to d i e.
he’s that one angel/demon oc that i feel like every weeb has had at one point or another :,)
he’s best friends with Iridium, the one eyed cat demon i’ve posted before.
#spoofydtiys !!
i really enjoyed doing this! i never really draw animals so it was fun to try something new 😊
Kenny, the chaotic dumbass bi and Grace, the tired but willing businesswoman.
i gotta start doing traditional art more often, m gettin rusty :/
also i kinda fucked up Luca on the last picture but he’s still cute.
lazy doodles of sleepy babies. 💕 
Ray is not a morning person.
(Ray takes their piercings out at night bc they have a fear of them being ripped out or lost while they sleep.)
i feel like their mornings go like: “Babe, I love you so much but that sweater is so fucking ugly.” “Well somEBODY HAS TO WEAR THEM, MICHAEL.” (he likes to pick out the ugliest sweaters at goodwill because he feels bad for them, would you believe that he’s the top?) meanwhile Ray is still sitting snuggled in the blankets, wondering how they got such perfect significant others.
Charlie is one of those boys with annoyingly perfect eyelashes and eyes but covers them up with his hair.
also Mikey always looks tired and high and Ray always looks like an innocent ray of sunshine.
the boyfriends.💕
Charlie and Mikey, Ray’s boyfriends! 
also no i don’t know how to draw a joint i’m a good Christian boy.
it me uwu.
yes i own that sweatshirt.
they is,,, babey🥺
this is Raymond! or more affectionately known as Ray. they are an upcoming character in my story Immortal but Destructible, and they have two boyfriends named Mikey and Charlie. 
they are all in the healthiest, cutest, and most cuddliest poly relationship and i love them all.
low quality oc time? i think the fuck yes. my first shitpost, i’m so proud 😭
sad mullet hours ✌️
honestly? i’d die for him. Instagram really loves to mess with quality, huh? every time i post it gets more and more pixelated idk how to stop it :,).
(Clancy from The Midnight Gospel)
Suga always was one of my favorites 💕
Suga from Haikyuu!!
sometimes i forget that my art actually turns out okay when I try.
eugh.
i never draw anything below the collarbone and it shows. i also don’t know how to draw wings but i still like the way this came out uwu.
i,, i can explain,,,
,,,,,
his name is Snail,,
i was missing drawing him,,,
Iridium is one of my earliest OCs dating back to like 2018.
yes he’s one of those floating head creatures those are cool okay :,)
i’ve been neglecting my actual art because i discovered the symmetry thing on my app but i really just wanted to make a floofy boy so whoops.
(they don’t have names? help??) i don’t know what it is with my mind and making my dreams gay and strange but these are two characters from my dream from a couple days ago.
there’s a short summary of my dream on the last slide but it’s brief and dumb, I’ll make a story eventually but i have two ongoing stories rn so,,,
to start off mermay: Leif!
Leif is an upcoming character in my story “Suddenly Green was his Favorite Color” on Wattpad and he’s best boy.
hi i’ll have uuuhhhhhh respect women juice plz
prince.
baby boy, baby. 
this boy don’t have no name yet but i’m still smitten 🥺
angry boyo? another new boyo? yessir.
another avian baby 🥺💕
the first name that came into my head was Roderick idfk why but i guess that’s his name now.
tryin somethin’ 3/3
i hope this turns out good 😅
edit: it did (i think ,,,)
tryin somethin’ 2/3
tryin somethin’ 1/3
though i’m wolf.
disobedience.
some sticker designs, i really like the first one for some reason.
look at me testing out some of my styles. 
the first one is Jim from treasure planet because i just watched that for the first time since i was like 5 and whew i love him. the second one is just a bean i just drew them who are they and the last one is a current project, my boys Alex and Jake from my story Lost and Found on wattpad.
hi i’m mason i do art and stuff.
my posts will consist of my babies and my babies only (jk it depends on the post).
uhhhhhhh i’ll probably do a “meet the artist” eventually but for now here’s some of my favorite things i’ve done recently💕
also my style is hella inconsistent sorry about that.
