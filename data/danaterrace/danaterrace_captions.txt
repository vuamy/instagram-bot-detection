We’ve come so far but we’re still not done.
See you in the New Year. ❤️ 
#theowlhouse 
PS this cover fuckin rules
For fun :)

Got a lot of new followers recently! Thank you for stopping by and for all your kind words 💜. Just a gentle reminder that this is a personal account for my own work and that may include body horror, nudity, and macabre/mature themes. Or weird bs like this. Thanks! -D
2021 was an extremely difficult year and I feel like it showed in just how little I drew for myself. Too burnt out from life/work to draw, do talks, or do anything really. But today I’m gonna focus on the positives and grab some goddamn coffee to start off 2022 right. Whatever your goals for the year are I hope they happen. 🤘
I caught some awful bug last month so of course all I wanted to draw was Titan Luz in different outfits. #theowlhouse #theowlhousefanart 
OH YEAH HAPPY ANNIVERSARY, WATCHING AND DREAMING!
Gave a talk at Ringling College of Art and Design last week to speak about my experiences in the industry. Thanks for having me! I lost for my voice for a good 3 days after that haha.
Do you think you can fix my heart? 💔 
 
RIP Akira Toriyama. I loved drawing your characters and living in your worlds. This was a small animation test I did back in 2013. Original DragonBall is still one of my all time favorite shows to rewatch.
Reupload of an older drawing. Just made some small edits till I liked it better. :)
Nothin much
Thank you for inviting me to this ✨FAN EVENT✨! Excited to be a part of it. 
Panel will be streamed on my Twitch account!

PRINT RESTOCK! 
🦉
For #TheOwlHouse’s 4 year anniversary these episode 1 poster prints have been restocked in my @streamily.live store. ❤️ All signed and personalized. Streamily.com/danaterrace or link in bio!
Last self portrait from 2023. Drawing has become SO chaotic and frustrating this year. Feels like every time I try something I’m learning from the beginning. But I’ve been through this before and I know I’ll push through (eventually), so I’m not looking for burn out tips, just venting. Let’s fucking GO 2024.
Faces while watching TV. Pencil, micron, copics. 
#inkdrawing #sketching
Thank you @studiobadegg and @lyra_art for this beauty!!! Agh I can’t get over how freakin cool she looks. 
#theowlhouse
I’m always drawing her. Ever since high school. Maybe I’ll share more. Haha I forget why I doodled myself.
Merry Christmas, have some never before seen #TheOwlHouse sketches! 1) Doodling to get myself in the headspace for Watching and Dreaming post retakes. 2) Gus and Hunter human realm clothes while we were writing Thanks to Them. 3) First ever sketch of the Collector. He changed so much!! I much prefer his final design but this version will always hold a place in my heart. 4) Just sketching cute stuff for fun. 5) First sketch of Huntlow when we started developing their relationship. 
That's all for now byyyyeeeeee!
Creepin crawlin back to bed. 😴 Progress vid goin up on Patreon soon.
HAPPY HOOTLIDAYS or something! 🎁

HELLAWEEN! 🦇
Congrats, @dinolich! It’s such a fun and stylish comic. I was originally just doodling Sloane but they were so fun to draw I ended up adding everyone else haha. Looking forward to volume 2! 
Highly recommend for anyone who hasn’t already read it! #hellaween
Young #Hellboy doodles!
Self portrait of me spacing out instead of letting myself space out.

Still catching up on 5 yrs worth of games. Currently, Octopath II with the scholar who mugs people lmao #octopathtraveler #octopathtraveler2
Self portrait practice. Pretend the tattoos are there. 😎
I just wanted to draw her again.
Playing with projects that don’t exist, wearing my influences on my sleeve, but most importantly having fun. 🐈‍⬛
Recently had to move my whole art setup to a new location while work is being done on my place. Finally feeling more comfortable and getting back into drawing. For now here’s Coco from #witchhatatelier!
Babysitting for immortal and semi-immortal beings. #theowlhouse
From a tiny King, an outcast witch, a hopeful human, and one tired cartoonist, Thanks For Watching. ❤️ We hope you enjoy the finale tomorrow.
Getting back into my sketchbook
When I was a kid I would always draw these cat twins going on perilous adventures on their way home from school. Ghosts, dinosaurs, and mine-cart chases! It’d be sick if I could ever find those sketchbooks and do something wild like that haha.
Some wishful raeda lineart from 2021 #theowlhouse
Couldn’t sleep so rewatching Better Call Saul! #bettercallsaul - Turning off comments on this one in the hope that ppl might read the caption first (strenuous i know).
Been watching Columbo. I think I drew him a lil too smarmy here but it’s all good fun. #columbo
5 years apart. 🥲
Our first record for Luz in 2018 and our last, just yesterday. Thank you for EVERYTHING @snarkler, you are the spirit of the show! And an extra special thank you to @edenriegel for being there every step of the way as the best voice director (and best voice of Boscha haha)!!!

I’m pretty ambivalent towards photos of myself, especially for professional headshots. But I needed new ones so why not tintype portraits by @cheatdeathtintype! Thank you Amanda, I LOVE them!

Rewatched Mirror Mask
The @gorillaz artbook came out today and I’m so insanely honored to be a part of it and be surrounded by so many artists I admire. Definitely a highlight of my artistic career.

When you realize you might not have your shit together because you’re 12 and you just stole money from the one teacher who’s nice to you to buy candy that you eventually throw up.

Animation crews put a lot of love and hard work into every frame, your favorite shows couldn’t be made without them! That’s I’m showing support for the union as we enter negotiations so teams can receive more livable wages and reasonable schedules (among other necessities). ❤️ @animationguild
A few more. These BG colors were increasingly frustrating.
Getting back into having fun. Based off some random people I saw that day.
Another from last year
Nother self portrait from earlier this year
Spooky day, spooky old stuff.
Happy Halloween 💀

1 yr ago at The Owl House’s premiere party with the crew. 💜 (technically was Jan 10 ah well)
#theowlhouse premiered and I couldn’t have asked for a better group of people to be around for the night. To my friends, coworkers, and everyone who’s supported me this far, THANK YOU! Can’t wait to show you more. 🦉
Happy New Year, friends. Thanks for making 2019 so special. 🎉❤️
A few people have been sending me pics of Owl House posters from the parks. I had no idea they’d be advertised there and it’s a thrill seeing them out in the wild!
