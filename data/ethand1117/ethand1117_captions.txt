Wishing the happiest of 21st birthdays to my partner in crime😘😘 the amount of shit we’ve been through is astronomical but I couldn’t have gotten through any of it without you!! ❤️ the energy you bring to this world is unmatched and you’ve only scratched the surface of what you will accomplish in your life!!!! I love you so much Aminah and I hope you have the best birthday ever🥰🥰🥰
Happy happy happy (belated🙄) birthday to the most perfect human being on this planet!!! I seriously don’t know where I’d be in life without your unwavering love and support, no matter how far from each other we are🥺 you deserve the world and I hope you know I’d move heaven and earth for you any day of the week! Seriously, words cannot describe how much I love you Emily,  you are the kindest and most thoughtful person I have ever met (and most definitely are my parents favorite child😂) I love you indefinitely you strong, beautiful, passionate, and incredibly powerful woman!!!!❤️❤️❤️

I don’t even know what words to use to describe how much my mom means to me. Whether it’s scooting over time make room for me to sit next to her in her chair (even at 19 years old) or listening to me complain about the stupidest things at 11pm, she is always there for me AND whoever else she needs to be there for. I love you so much Momma happy Mother’s Day ❤️
Honestly... It is what it is
Ok here we go. Happy Birthday to my twin, my best friend, my partner in crime. Y’all don’t understand what it feels like to have Jay in your life, I would not be who I am and I would not be enjoying school now without the help of @moose_jaws she is so amazing and so talented words can’t even describe! Everyone who knows Jay knows they are lucky to have her in their life and I am so grateful that I get to call you my twin! I love you so much and I hope that you have the best birthday every Jay!!! ❤️❤️❤️
Felt obligated to post for semester but honestly this has been a wild ride and I wouldn’t have done it any differently thanks to these people and so many more not pictured! Also realizing how many pictures I have of my G 🤪
