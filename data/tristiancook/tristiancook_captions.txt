(When you skip a workout during the week anyway)
.
I know as soon as I stop bulking I'll immediately lose 10 pounds. It's a daily struggle between wanting that summer cut and also knowing my metabolism could eat elaphants for breakfast
Was walking to the Jim this morning when-
28 and Feeling Great 🎂 🥳♏🎉
.
.
I'm so thankful to be where I am in life and if you were to ask me what my future looked like I never could've dreamed I would be here now. I'm truly grateful for everyone who's pushed me to keep going and has loved me through it all. 
.
In true Scorpio fashion I've never been one to seek out friendships, but after retrospection and seeing my circle grow I also want to say how thankful I am to have my friends and family who are always there for me 💙

Swipe to see such a great time at one of my favorite sushi spots. And also me doing a double jump as Dora the Explorer.

A lil video recap reel of our time in Guanajuato. My home state. It was a chance to reconnect, refresh, recharge. One of the most colorful cities I’ve ever experienced. My first time as an adult doing our own thing & @tristiancook’s first time out of the US. So many sights, foods, experiences. We covered ~13 miles on foot in 2 days. Can’t wait to share the photos! We probably took way too many hehe 🇲🇽 @guanajuato_mex

Happy #pridemonth babez🏳️‍🌈 For so many years, so many of us have been scared to be our authentic selves. We hide, pretend to be tougher, put ourselves into a box, etc. and for what? Fear of judgement, rejection, losing everything. All valid fears — but if we can’t accept & love ourselves, how can we expect that from anyone else? This month is about celebrating the progress & impact the LGBTQ+ community has made in our world, but yet we must also remember how much more there is to make. I admire all the people of our community who live their lives unapologetically, and I admire all the ones before us that allowed us to be where we are today..& for those that aren’t out, take your moment when it feels right.

In the heart of L.A. @jorgefabian and some friends and I found this modern cafeteria tucked away, with bold flavors and imaginative ideas
•
After we flew home, we happened to find their cookbook 🔥
•
"The strength of this city's pulse is in its culinary identity, one that crosses many boundaries."
•
"What defines LA's food culture is it's eclectic communities, Mediterranean climate, local farming, and the fact that it has one of the largest ports in the country with access to exotic produce, livestock, and spices from all over the world 🌎" 
•
Tonight, after two days of prep, we got to recreate their charred Tandoori chicken, with a cool mango coconut toss of basil and a tamarind vinaigrette.
•
Obviously I added some Arkansas to it with a side of roasted Cajun gemstone potatoes
😌
Bon appetit

It's been a while IG. It's pretty scary right now, I'm still working. Our Starbucks is still open, and we're serving a lot of medical personel. If I feel safe, and my team feels safe, handing out these cups of strength to those fighting for us feels kinda good.
.
Isolation is a powerful force, but once you realize we're still connected even if we can't see one another, isolation loses. Some people have a harder fight though, don't let it win; we've all got the ability to reach out and defeat  it for someone else. Stay in touch, just not physical😁, and stay safe♥️
Do you know how fast you were going?

Facts: The change you want to see isn't going to happen in a month, or even a year, depending on your goals. I began my journey in 2014, with no prior knowledge, before realizing two years later that this was my passion. Seeing what I've done for myself, I now know I'm supposed to help others. Health of Body and Mind. Strength and Confidence. These are things that I struggled with before I decided that I wasn't going to anymore. 
Truth: You don't have to do this alone like I did. If you're ready to make a change and kickstart your growth, overcome your weaknesses, and take control of your life, I want to help you. Just swipe left and message me😉
Can we even be serious for once?

Yes. Yes we can 🌪️

Hit 'em with the shoulder #progress ! 
Currently increasing my size and still enjoying the water this summer. Everyone should feel confident enough to live their best lives poolside, no matter what bends, dips, droops, or stretches. 
Body positivity is something I've claimed I've always been an advocate for but the truth is I still struggled a lot harder than I should have throughout my life, just thinking myself to death over what everyone's opinions of my flesh might be.

I have never weighed this much in my life. I'm 15 pounds up from last summer. You can see it in my neck when I look down. You can see it in my belly when I bend over and everything bunches like the worst pile of pancakes. 
But you can also see it in the growing stacks of weight I lift, you can see it in the things I can achieve, and you can definitely see it in the power I feel. I now know everyone feels a little insecure, feels scrutinized, or feels judged- From the new mom post baby, to the person with shredded aesthetics, lifting huge weight; no matter the step of your journey, just know that you are more than what your skin looks like. 
Thank you @jorgefabian for helping me learn this, for being my gym partner and for constantly reassuring me that I'm on the right track. 
I'm excited for the future
