This girl has given me the best year of my life. She's my best friend and the most beautiful scary movie buddy in the world. She's loved me through a lot and all I want to do is be the best man I can be for her. It doesn't feel like a whole year already but I'm so in love with this girl and the days have gone by so fast. I've enjoyed every bit of our lives so far and can't wait to see what the future holds. One year down!!!!

P.S- don't mind the old man twerking, his jam just came on.
Back in the office. Just trying to get my cardio back up!!!

No other human in this world that I would've rather seen Beartooth with. They're our favorite band together and Caleb is my favorite artist and song writer. It meant the world to both of us to be able to watch him sing his songs that have had such an impact on both of our lives. We've both been through the darkness but we somehow found each other in this crazy world.
And of course.....mosh pits!!!!!

Any chance I get to say I love this girl, I'm going to say it. I'll hold the details but this girl saves me everyday of my life. It was a rough 2023 and start to 2024. But through all the hell I went through there was a lot of happiness because I had my best friend and my whole future right by my side. And of course my Dixie and Mitty!!!
Went to see the Christmas lights at CALM with the family and my beautiful girly. No picture is safe with me and she started it üòÇ. She‚Äôs crazy for dealing with me but I love her ‚ù§Ô∏è
My sleepy girls ‚ù§Ô∏è
It‚Äôs been a long day.
I dropped Dixie off at the vet this morning and didn‚Äôt expect her to have to get surgery today. She was so good and she‚Äôs home and healthy. It helps remind me of how good of a life I have with my 2 girls and Stephanie coming into my life. We even have a new edition to the family with Tommy the chinchilla. This is true happiness. I love my girls‚ù§Ô∏è
Crazy about this girlüòÅ

Always love getting the chance to get out and spend quality time with @daddoesadventure!
2 years ago today I almost made the worst decision to take my own life. Which in fact was the flipside to that, because the best decision I ever made was to stick around. I follow my dream everyday I get to train and become a better man in my life. I can say that martial arts literally saved my life. My mom got to keep all 3 of her boys and my nephews got to keep their man-child uncle. Once they understand emotions, they'll finally understand how they helped save me. And of course, my girls got to keep their cat dad. Now I can't imagine me being absent in my family's life without a goodbye and without them knowing what I was going through mentally everyday. Life always finds a way to be beautiful and I found the blueprint to endless happiness. God had to tell me himself it just wasn't my time, I had a gym family I needed to meet, I have nephews I have to watch grow up, I have to watch the happiest days of my mom's life and most of all, I have to see this life through. The biggest fight of my life was anything but physical and it's a part of who I am. I need to always remember that I made it through my darkest thoughts and trusted the invisible hand reaching out to me, I still can't explain that night but I'll always believe it was divine intervention. I never really went to church, but God still loved me enough to give me another chance at bliss and the strength to find it. I love to walk this world alone in life now but every second of everyday I feel his presence, there's an energy I feel when I talk to God, he's been listening all along, it was me who didn't have the faith before. Thanks to everyone who stuck by my side these past 2 years, you've been a part of the best 2 years of my life. The first 30 years aren't a wash, it just took me longer than others to come around, but I'm here and I'm happy and I love y'all!

Best decision I've ever made was walking into this gym. Who would've thought that training would change who you are as a person? When it becomes part of your identity there's something buried in you that can't let it go and I never will. There's gyms, then there's @lion_heart_mma and y'all know exactly what I mean. This is our gym in our small corner of the world led by a martial arts genius @primaltac . It's us against the worldüí™

I always end up making a couple videos haha. I just can't explain the peace I'm at when I feel the atmosphere of the gym. Life really is about doing what you love around people you care about. This gym family is the best.

If the only thing wrong with me this week is a bruised shin, that's more than enough reason to get in and train.

Sometimes you just gotta break it down and work the basics. I'm in love with working my biggest weapons in my left hand and left roundhouse. Liver kicks are the most beautiful thing in the world.

Keeping it simple with just a 1-2 and a switch. I'm going to trust the process of the work I'm putting in on my knee. I know it looks foolish of me to be so inconsistent with my decisions about training, but it's more foolish to give up on something I completely love. I vow to not let my emotions control my mind and just face the fact these injuries are just a part of who I am. Patience is the key here, so this will be my office for the time being. Love y'all at @lion_heart_mma and thanks for knowing I'm never done, even when I say I am. We all know where I belong.

Jesus, I really need to do something about my garageüò¨. But I gotta work the hands too, as much as I love kicks, the fists are also an aspect of the game... punches set up kicks. I have a good mentor to understand these things. Thanks coach @primaltac .

Just in my office for now. Working and waiting to be healthy! Never felt so at home at @lion_heart_mma . Life is better with y'all in it.

Well winning gold in jiu-jitsu was something I didn't envision over a year ago when I walked back into @lion_heart_mma . I was soul set on striking alone. After peer pressure, for my own good, I finally decided to start solely to further my relationship with the gym family. Then I fell in love, my feelings for kickboxing faded and my focus became jiu-jitsu. This is years of dealing with injuries and finally feeling good enough to go. I said I wanted a sub in my first ever match and dammit I wasn't settling for anything less. I only wanted to threaten the guillotine to pass but I felt it deep right away and rode it out. Thank you to @primaltac for convincing me to take jiu-jitsu then believing in me that I was ready so early on. I'm only ever ready because of the knowledge passed down from a great mind and having great training partners. It's been a helluva ride!

Finally got to run a call with the one who inspired me to do EMS, my very own brother @bjcorey35.
Coaching, training and fighting, everything I've ever dreamed of. @lion_heart_mma will always hold a place in my heart!!! @primaltac has forever changed my life!!!
#muaythai #jiujitsu #family #fightingfamily #duespaid #hardwork #ambition
Had a nice little spontaneous trip to get the chance to meet a couple guys that put in the time and are a true inspiration. Because if you train, you know what it takes, and these guys have made it. @justin_gaethje and @chitoveraufc are true gentlemen and a pleasure to meet.

Had an amazing time with my best friend/ brother @bjcorey35, @marie_ann_c and my two favorite little guys supporting the @lion_heart_mma family. Everybody did amazing and I'm just glad I got to watch everybody. Til the next one!!!!

The me today is all about putting my time and money into things that mean something to me. I'm not going to get too deep here but I just want to touch on mental health, it's a problem and even more so for the men and women who have to go through hell so we don't have to. 22 veterans take their lives a day, that means 22 families heart's have to break and never be the same. And thank you to the @til_valhalla_project for shining a light on the situation. Whenever you look around and see your family, friends and everything you can be thankful for, just remember why you have that privilege. After seeing and living through hell, it's hard to come back the same. I personally know multiple veterans that have taken their own lives and my heart is with any family that has to deal with a loss like this. I always thank the lord and my heros fighting for my freedom. All gave some, some gave all.

When @bjcorey35 and @marie_ann_c leave me in charge of taking the crazies home. They voted unanimously for once in their lifetimes together!!!

If you aspire to do anything in life don't waste another day not working towards it. I've always had a dream of becoming a coach at anything in life and thanks to @richiemeister , I not only get to coach my favorite sport, I get to coach one of my favorite little guys in life. I love this sport, I love my nephews and I love @lion_heart_mma
