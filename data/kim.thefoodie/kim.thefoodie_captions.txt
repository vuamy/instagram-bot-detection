Tips for the best flat croissant based on my experience ⬇️

‼️DON’T use too much butter & honey. I found I only needed 1 or 2 tablespoons of each for 3 mini croissants.

✅ DO let them cool on parchment paper to prevent sticking! They should cool for at least 5 minutes before touching them as the sugar from the honey makes them extremely hot out of the pan!

So are you going to try it or what?

Did I just discover the easiest way to make cinnamon rolls without actually making cinnamon rolls? 🌝

I can’t believe how delish these sticky cinnamon roll croissants turned out - especially since I was just hoping to save my stale croissants! 10/10 would recommend trying 💖🥐💕

6. Cover with foil and bake on 375F for 15 minutes. Uncover and bake for another 15 minutes.

Weird is subjective right? 🙃

It’s so interesting when I think about how past experiences have shaped my habits in the kitchen! 🥣

What’s your main focus when it comes to cooking at home?
pizza and caesar salad is already an iconic duo, but this method takes the combo to another level 🍕🌿💕

believe it or not, i added salad to the pizza before it was cooked and it worked out so well! 

i started by combining a couple handfuls of the zesty kale caesar salad from @artefoods with a little olive oil and kosher salt, and then treated it like a regular pizza topping. pretty simple way to add a little veg 🥣

the salad blend is made with hearty veggies like kale and broccoli so it’s perfectly fine to bake in the oven 💚

you also have to try topping your pizza with a scoop of the fresh salad for the ultimate zesty bite 🥰

This is hands down my new favourite way to do chicken thighs 🍗

A confession: It wasn’t until recently that I discovered the magic of a stainless steel frying pan and using one has been LIFE CHANGING so far ❤️‍🔥

Now I’m looking for inspo!! - What’s your fave thing to cook using stainless steel?
Life has been kinda busy lately so I’ve been leaning towards reallllly simple meals with equally easy clean-up 🧼 

This is tomato miso butter gnocchi was thrown together in less than 20 minutes and it was just perfection 🤌

I started by melting about 4 tbsp of butter on medium and adding 3 cloves of garlic (sliced) and a pint of grape tomatoes (halved). 

Once that started to cook down I added about 2 tbsp of tomato paste, 2 tbsp miso paste and 2 tbsp honey. 

This is where things started to get thick, so I poured in a 1/2 cup of starchy water from cooking the gnocchi before tossing my cooked gnocchi with the sauce. 

The sauce was so rich & creamy - you wouldn’t believe there isn’t actually any cream in it (just a ton of butter lol)

A few clips from my recent trip to Vancouver Island 🌲🌊🌸

First of all, the food in both Victoria and Tofino was absolutely amazing! I’ll be making a separate post with a breakdown of some of my fave spots (spoiler: lots of seafood) 🍽

Other than that, it was incredible just being outside and taking in all of the gorgeous nature on the island. Can you believe the size of those trees!?
A totally customizable ravioli and veggie bake!

Start by covering the bottom of an oven-safe dish with your favourite tomato sauce, then layer over uncooked ravioli and veggies of your choice (I used zucchini and mushrooms). 

Top the ravioli and veggies with just enough tomato sauce to cover everything in a thin layer. Cover with foil and bake at 350F for 45 minutes. 

Remove foil and top with mozzarella, parmesan and dried parsley. Bake uncovered for another 15 minutes (or until the cheese is melted) ❤️

Enjoy 🤗

It truly pains me to say this but I think I need to cut back on my caffeine intake 💔

I feel like multiple cups of coffee a day isn’t doing great things for my anxiety as I find myself getting shakier around lunch time. 

I love coffee so much but I’m going to start to cut back by having just one small cup a day or substituting it with matcha 🍵

Today, my coffee is accompanied by lots of ice and almond milk 🧊

I’m excited to see if cutting back will make me feel better. Stay tuned 💗
