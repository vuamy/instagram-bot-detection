What a season. Yes it was COLD! I sat for hours with no luck. I took two weeks vacation to hunt and was sidelined with pneumonia. Then last week I kicked up this buck and wasn't able to get an ethical shot off... BUT patience and persistence paid off tonight! Thank you to the man upstairs for this beaty and the meat he'll provide for the year.  So happy right now.

Very slow afternoon, but managed to roll this ol girl out of someone's flooded backyard... #LakeChamplain #BassFishing #LargeMouth #Bass #BassPro #RodBender #DuckettRods
Pulled this ol girl out of the woods, literally.. Went 22" long and had to be dang close to 5lbs 
Pretty happy I decided to fish today needless to say!

This is pretty incredible right here. You don't hear about this kind of thing happening every day. The four of us have been involved in baseball together, either playing against each other or playing with each other, since Day 1. You name it, Little League, Middle School, Summer Ball, High School Ball, College Ball, we've all been together from Day 1 to now. You guys are my brothers, family. What a time it has been, for all of us, together. Love you guys, it's been a hell of a ride.
