So earlier this week Nayama turned 4!!! I also realized, as I recounted the events of that day(as I always do, cuz it is my Forever Favourite Day) that I never truly expressed my deepest n most gratitude to the 2 woman who were with us every second of that time, Tolewa Oyewole and Fasanmi Akinsegun. These 2 woman(along with the rest of their family)who didn’t really know me very well but knew that now we were family, showed me and Nayama sisterhood and love instantly and unconditionally. I am so thankful to you both for that time. I love that you are a part of that, now, hilarious story! Thank you Tolewa and Tola for all that you did for me during and after pregnancy. Nayama couldn’t be more blessed to have 2 beautiful Aunties on her side. So every year on her birthday while I celebrate her I always think of you two fondly as well 🌿🚂👶🏾love you Aunty Tolewa n Titi!!!! 😘😘#imnotababyimabiggirl
Ok school got her today!!!#jktings#tuckeredout#mygirl❤️
So Nayama had her First Day of School this week starting Junior Kindergarten!!! I handled it like a champ!! Lol ( maybe not) But she did!!! First few shots are before school n the last few are after school. I love difference in her poses and how her uniform shirt has come out. I’m so proud of her!!! She has faced this new chapter of her life head on and with the life force that she is!!! Watch out world Nayama is coming for You!!!!!! #brainsnbeauty#mygirl❤️#loveher#proudmama
