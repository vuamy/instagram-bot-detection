Also Sylis is very good at flying a kite

Throw back to the year you became a mom 
Happy Mother’s Day, Momma, I love you ♥️
These spot the differences are getting pretty tough •_•
Same sign, seven years apart :)

Getting into painting with my junior year production of Mary Poppins was when I had my big, “oh shit, I actually love this stuff” moment. Now as a whole adult, going into my second year at Lyric, I am once again loving this stuff :)

2024 Lyric’s Mary Poppins Vs. 2017 Parkview High Mary Poppins
Happy Closing to the gorgeous new work ~ King Of Pangea ~!
This floor was the most rewarding project I’ve worked on so far, and this show was just lovely to experience, I hope it goes far :)
Got the show photos and some fun behind the scenes stuff :)

This one is a lemon loaf from Trader Joe’s iced to hell 👍
I put the icing powder pack from the loaf into regular vanilla icing and then refrigerated it so it would hold shape and it worked pretty well !
Yayay collage :)

I made another dumb looking delicious cake ! 
This one is a cherry cake, soaked with cherry filling sauce, coated in a chocolate cheesecake frosting and topped with a ton of little pie filling cherries. It’s amazing!
Weird cake! Great taste !

A very productive shop reset ! 
After a bonkers summer season, I spent some quality time getting the shop clean and doing little texture samples with all the materials I found in the shop from over the years.

Got my official letter today— I’m sticking around at Lyric theatre full time now :))

Living in dreams
Watercolor on arches paper

This one was terrifying because I’ve loved it every step of the way and watercolor is not known for being forgiving. 
I was going for a surreal look at nostalgia and regret, touched with the optimism and hope that comes with time.

One time like two years ago I thought it would be very French of me to smoke an herbal cigarette in the shower. Here’s a painting of that French moment with a palette inspired by this other painting of a pear.
