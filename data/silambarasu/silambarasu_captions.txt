I could write a long ass essay on what the experience of acting in Dara, Darah dan Amarah meant to me! It's been such an enriching and gratifying learning experience, one that I'll treasure forever! It's cool to discover that this is something I could do, not saying I'm perfect but I can learn and improve and grow. 

All my gratitude to my director @acapxrn for taking me on this project and having the faith that I could be Kavin, a vessel to tell a part of the story he wanted to tell, forever indebted!

The amazingly talented fellow actors from whom I've learned so much, couldn't have done this without you all! 

To @mrjul97 for making us all look slayyy, thank you!!

To one of my favourite people @kaamidi_peace who is basically the reason how I ended up being part of this play, I'm so happy I got to do this with you dearrr!

And everyone else involved in the production of Dara, Darah dan Amarah, I'm so proud of all of us!

And to my friends and family that came to watch the play, you all know who you are, you have no idea how much it meant to me.

So much love for you all!

We have very few tickets left for tonight, and tomorrow’s tickets are also selling fast. Do get your ticket asap to secure your seats! See yall soon 🫶🏼
I've always been fascinated by actors and the art of acting - how it must feel to be able to live the lives of various people, who may or may not exist and may or may not have relation to yours, on screen or on stage. With this exciting play called Dara, Darah & Amarah (Of Blood, Virginity & Fury) by @ejklsseni I get the opportunity to have a little taste of that world that I never thought I'd get firsthand glimpse into and hope to deliver a decent performance, at the least.

Dara, Darah & Amarah (Of Blood, Virginity & Fury) tells the story of a group of friends who reconnect after years only to discover secrets of lives that may put their bond to test. Premiering on 25th August, this play will have a 6-day run, 25th to 27th August and 1st to 3rd September, at pangkin@ejklsseni!

Come watch and support local talent. Further details and tickets at link in bio.

With everything we've all gone through in the last few years, it seems like one has to make a conscious choice to be optimistic, to somehow continue to cling to the hope that things will get better, the world will become a safer place and we all will continue to find ways to restore the sense of normalcy in our lives however possible. Here's to making 2022 as good a year as possible.

@instadanjlevy, I could never thank you enough for giving this world Schitt's Creek, the gift that keeps on giving. You make this world a better place simply by existing. I love you and you're simply the best!

@annefrances I don't know how to explain this but you and your portrayal of Alexis Rose have become so, so dear to my heart and I love you and I worship you, thank you for being you and bringing all of us so much joy! You're an angel!

Have been feeling very awful about my body lately because I don't look like how I did two years ago after losing weight. Because I don't look like one of the muscular/skinny/well-toned men, especially gay men, that I see everywhere on social media.  And my #bodydysmorphia has been getting worse.

So, I took these pictures to remind myself that every body is beautiful even if it doesn't fit into the conventional beauty standards, it's a cliché but I think it's something everyone who feels bad about their body needs to constantly remind themselves of. 

No abs or waxed body or chiselled torso here and that's fine.

I love my body and on days that I don't, I'll make a conscious effort to do something to make myself feel good about my body.

This year hasn't been an easy one for any of us and we all found joy and solace in every little thing in our lives. Or we tried to. 😌❤ But hey, we are almost at the end of it and let's hope 2021 will be kinder to all of us

I found great joy in this little Canadian show called #SchittsCreek! This show and one of the show's characters, Alexis Rose, played by the crazy talented Annie Murphy (@annefrances I love you so much!!) brought immeasurable joy into my life in this otherwise disastrous year! I cannot put into words how much this show and the characters mean to me and how much I related to and found comfort in Alexis's growth and how the show depicted her character (and others) with zero judgment! 🥺💖

If you haven't seen the show, please do, you will not regret it. It's Simply The Best! (if you got this reference you're awesome! 🙌🏾)

And here are some pictures of me wearing a cute t-shirt inspired by Alexis's iconic "Ew, David!" that I got from @the.beau.studio!

Best Friend Appreciation post.

Being your friend has been one of the best things that's happened to me. I'm lucky to have a best friend like you, you have always been there for me and I hope I have been there for you when you needed me, and will be in the future. You are important and you are loved.

Whatever hard time you are going through, remember it is temporary. You are strong and you are surroundedby the love of people to whom you matter a great deal.

I love you, even if you annoy me a lot ❤🤗

It's not his birthday and I know it's not Friendship day but I just wanted to show some love and appreciation for my best friend, Alex. 💖

It's been 5 years since we've known each other (though it feels longer than that) and the story of how we became friends is pretty interesting but without getting into the details I'll just say that this friendship is sort of an unexpected one but it's definitely one of the best relationships of my life. Ever.

Alex is a generous, loving, beautiful, cherubic, hardworking soul and he is TRULY one of a kind. His presence is comforting - I know this for a fact even if we haven't met each other (bloody covid!) -, he knows his ways with people and how to make them feel good and his sense of humour is not for everybody but if you learn to enjoy it, he's hilarious.

 I'm not exaggerating but if not for him I probably wouldn't have grown to love myself in spite of all my flaws. Whoever has a friend like Alex is a really lucky person! I know I am 😁

So, Alex, my dearest babu, I just want to say that you are an absolute angel with so much love and creative pleasure to give to the world and the people around you. The world is a much better place with you in it and I KNOW that you have better things ahead of you, they are probably just stuck somewhere or lost their way but they will eventually find you. Good things come to those who wait, they say. So, we'll wait and in the meantime go make some fun TikToks and YouTube videos to shoo away these not so good times!

And when you go on the stage to accept your Academy award, I'll be expecting a shoutout for being an absolutely amazing friend! 😂 

I love you, babu, thank you for being my friend! ❤💖🤗😘

I spent the first half of yesterday doubting myself while preparing for and cooking all the dishes, anxious for all of them to turn out well! And I was incredibly tired by the end of it all!

But when everyone ate the food I cooked and said every dish tastes delicious, I truly felt happy and content and almost teared up 😂

If it were possible, I'd cook and have family and friends over more often. Cooking good food for others (and myself, hehe) gives me a sense of happiness like very few other things do.

This cheesecake smacked me in the face, called me and my family names and I said thank you! This, hands down, is the BEST cheesecake I've had in my entire life!

Yet another year of not celebrating #ThalaDeepavali 😕

Wishing everyone who's celebrating a happy, joyous and prosperous Deepavali! Love and light!

This @houseofmasaba @masabagupta outfit is the first designer outfit I've ever bought and I felt absolutely amazing wearing it. Worth every single penny!

Final set of photos from my #trip to India - ALLEPPEY, KERALA!
.
Yes, it was as exquisite as Manoj Paramahamsa @manojinfilm showed us on #VinnaithaandiVaruvaaya!
.
Honestly, if you haven't been on a houseboat cruise and watched the sunset on the backwaters of Alleppey, you haven't lived! It was one of the most magical moments of my life. The serenity and calmness you get to feel here is next to none. I wish I was able to spend more time here but that was not to be.
.
But if you ever get the chance, go to Alleppey, stay on a boathouse and take it all in. You will not regret it!

It was love at first sight for me with Ooty! It was simply breathtaking! 
The train ride from Mettupalayam was one of the top highlights of my India trip! If you ever plan to visit Ooty or Coonoor, I highly recommend taking the steam train from Mettupalayam - the 5-hour ride is definitely an amazing experience!

Pondicherry, India (2019).
.

Tip: If you ever visit Pondicherry and are in the mood to go to the beach go to Paradise Beach - the most scenic and peaceful beach in the state!

I don't have a bucket list, don't have a list of places I want to visit (there's only one, for now) or things I want to do before I die but I was always determined that India would be the first ever country that I'll visit - I have no idea why. This year, I made it happen and it also turned out to be my first ever solo trip (it was exciting and nerve-wracking in equal measure) because you know people, they'll cancel on you after getting you all excited to do something new. But looking back, I'm glad they cancelled on me because this very relaxing trip taught me more about enjoying one's own company and made me a more independent individual. And towards the end of the trip I felt like Rani from Queen (watch this film if you haven't,  it's on #Netflix) and that's a great feeling!

These pictures are from Marina Beach, Chennai and Mahabalipuram. More pictures from other places that I visited are coming soon, exclusively for my supportive fans. Stay tuned! 😉😂

After 90+ days of abstaining from #cake and #chocolate, I #baked a cake for myself (#sadlife) and made some #donuts.
.
.
The cake is a #tresleches cake and honestly, it's A.M.A.Z.I.N.G! I'm in love!
.
.
The donuts were supposed to be #bakeddonuts but the batch I tested with had burnt in the oven 😭😂 so, I just went ahead and fried them. They still taste absolutely delicious! One is #sugarglazed and the other one with chocolate and #sprinkles on top.

Going to#Penang after 12/13 years felt very nostalgic. More so when I 'fondly' remembered how I fell down by the poolside, injured my head and ended up getting 12 stitches. Oh, such good times. #throwback #PulauPinang

How I wish I could go back in time and relive that day and know what was going through my mind.
.
.
.
It's funny how my family decided it was okay to have a little fun dressing me up as a girl, when I was all of 3, but later in life when I didn't have the masculinity a man supposedly should I was called "9" - the derogatory term Tamils use to address trans people - which affected me more than they realise..
.
.
.
But whatever it is, I can now proudly say that I have realised that self acceptance is a lifelong process and I am, now, progressing to become an individual who tries to be comfortable in the skin I live in spite of all of its imperfections.
.
.
.
Also, how pretty do I look here!😍😍😍 Even I want to give myself a big, tight hug and pinch those cheeks!

I feel damn good wearing this floral shirt. So, I had to ask a friend to take my picture. 🌼 #imextralikethat #imalsosuperbasic #makingyourinstagramfeedbetter
Me: Can you believe that nobody hits on someone this cute? 
Friend: Yeah... because you are not cute and you are a bitch most of the time. AND stop taking selfies like a teenager!

#Throwback to the time when our outing wasn't actually a day out watching a movie and having lunch. #bffs
In 1998, when I was only 6 I watched Jeans - which is my earliest movie-going memory, though my family says otherwise - and skipped a heartbeat seeing this perfection of a woman on screen. And I still do till date; my only woman crush. This woman is a bona fide movie star and - as clichéd as it may sound - the most beautiful woman in the world! There is just no one like her. There will never be. Happy Birthday Aishwarya! #HappyBirthdayAishwarya #Queen #fanboypost (This year's Cannes appearance is still giving me life!)
If I show this picture to my mother she'd ask, "Yen ipdi eee nu izhikkura?" Even she's jealous of my amazing smile. 💁#okaybye #latergram
We tried to find a corner with better lighting but eventually settled for "we can edit the picture later." But little did these girls realise that a picture with me doesn't need a filter. #aboutlastnight #imsofunny #bffs
This Deepavali I decided to be extra and wish you all a very Happy Deepavali with a picture of me posing "candidly". #deepavali #omgheiswearingblackonsuchanauspiciousday
3-4 years ago I thought this is my coolest picture ever but now it seems more funny than cool. 😂😂😂
#throwback
No, this is not a "looking-away-from-the-camera" pose! I had the honour of being the subject of two humans with mobile phone and wanted to take my picture. So, while I was being photographed by one person in  whose direction I'm looking in this picture the other person took the opportunity to click me from another angle. #thatsthestorybehindthispicture #throwback #Iaskedthemtotakemypictureactually #canitgetmorebasicthanthis

Today when we had to plan to meet up at a  train station, it hit me - we have grown. Life isn't the same as it was 18 years ago, when we first met in our primary school. 
Who knows where exactly our life choices will lead us? We can only hope that it will bring us to that one place we want to reach. Life, after all, is the most unpredictable game we'll ever play. 
So, hold your loved ones close to your heart. The rough patches you'll - inevitably - hit in the relationship notwithstanding the bond will only grow stronger. As an unknown wise person said, I think, at the end the destination doesn't matter, the journey does. And people you love, people who love you for who you are make the journey more beautiful.

Randomly came across a "2-ingredient Mango Ice-Cream" recipe online a few days back and was eager to give it a try. Made it today and Holly Golightly, does it taste amazing!! Very easy to make. The only disappointment was the amount of ice-cream 3 medium-sized mangoes yielded: pretty less. The taste was so good that I finished off everything within few minutes and wanted more of it.  #icecream #mangoicecream #beattheheat #softserve #homemade #IwouldmakeiteverydayifIcould #itwassogoodithinkillbedreamingaboutitfordays
That's my friend, Rasika. I think we have great smiles. (Actually hers is alright.) #goodvibes #thatswhatwrittenonmyshirt
I baked for the FIRST TIME - @buzzfeedtasty's 3-ingredient Hazelnut Brownies! The pessimist in me anticipated that it would turn out to be a failed attempt at baking but much to my relief it tastes alright. I'm averagely happy. (Also, if you think it looks more 'fried' than 'baked' don't ask me why.) #firstattempt #baking #brownies #theresfirstforeverything #kalauadasalahsilatunjukajar #nutellabrownies

Here’s a super cute picture of me and my cousin. Did you smile looking at this picture?
Good if you did.
If you didn’t – What? How could you not smile seeing this very, very cute picture of two cuties? *

Onto a somewhat serious note:
Honestly, I have a very vague memory of my childhood. I’m sure I have had many wonderful moments growing up but, alas, I don’t remember whatever happened prior to my schooling years very vividly. This makes my heart ache whenever I hear someone narrating something that happened in their childhood with so much gusto. I. too, wanted to reminisce all the splendid moments from my growing up years and have a stupid grin plastered on my face. Or remember something so precious that it would make my eyes moist. No, that’s not the case with me. However, in a way I’m grateful for that – because it also has enabled me to forget whatever unpleasantness I went through as a kid. (Yes, childhood isn’t always rainbow and sunshine!) So, here’s a #notetomyself and to everyone who is patiently reading this LONG post: Never ever lose the child in you. Keep her/him alive. Life’s better that way, I feel.

Couldn't find a picture more apt than this one to express my gratitude. Thanks to everyone who wished me yesterday, regardless of the medium. Thanks to those who know me personally and still putting up with me. I love you. To those who have me as their friend on Facebook, following me on Twitter and Instagram - Thank you for tolerating my gazillion posts ranging from mindless shit to Aishwarya Rai-related posts, from complains and rants to frightening selfies. You all are awesome. Thank you once again and I'll stop here.

Five months ago when we were told 30/11/2015 would be the last working day at Pointsoft, honestly, it was a little heartbreaking. It holds a lot of memories. And the last one month I spent working at a place called Scicom... I don't quite remember when was the last time I felt so lonely in a place with so many people. 😊 So, few days ago when I got a call to join back at Pointsoft, I couldn't be happier. So, here's to more happier working days. :) #throwback #lifecomesafullcircle #okaythatsnotaveryappropriatehashtag #butwhocares #allsmiles #friends
