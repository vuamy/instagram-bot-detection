Couldn’t take a birthday trip on my actual birthday in February due to school so I had to wait till late March for Spring Break to celebrate but after narrowing down destinations and thinking about what new places to explore, I figured that, Japan will always be there and so will the ancient ruins of Machu Picchu, but Koko 🐶 who just turned 13 this year, won’t be around forever and she deserves to enjoy every moment of the brief time she has here with us. So, we took her on a tropical vacation down to Mexico where she flew First Class for the very first time, entered Mexico for the very first time (where we somehow by-passed customs and she was never inspected) and was taken back by the humidity, heat and various smells that greeted her upon exiting the airport. We spent several days in the middle of the jungle of Tulum where she enjoyed the various beach clubs during the day and delicious restaurants at night. On day-5, we drove our rental car 3-hours Northeast to the very small fishing town of Chiquila, where we parked the car, hopped on a ferry boat (another Koko first) to stay 5-nights on an island called Isla Holbox, a remote island in the Mexican Caribbean that is approximately 1 mile wide and 26 miles long with no cars (only golf carts), spotty internet connection, lots of mosquitoes and the most gorgeous white sand beaches and clear clean ocean waters. Koko was in heaven! It was amazing waking up every morning, opening our door and stepping right on to the beach, her never really needing a leash walking at her own pace and everywhere being dog friendly. Just seeing her so happy and enjoying life and her being able to see and experience it differently from the little world she’s been given was truly the best birthday gift and I’m certain this won’t be her last international vacation.

Cambodia, your culture, rich and diverse, is a testament to the strength of tradition. The Apsara dancers, the Khmer cuisine, and the ancient temples of Angkor Wat are treasures that inspire wonder and admiration. Never in my life did I imagine I would be in your magnificence, yet there I stood, in such awe, bathed in your shadow. Even if only for a handful of days, the warmth from your embrace and the resilience of you, Cambodian people who have overcome a troubled history, are truly inspiring. May your future be as bright as your past is storied and may your story continue to be seen, spoken and heard. Saum Arkoun 🙏🏾 #cambodia #🇰🇭
There isn’t much I can tell you about Vietnam that hasn’t already been said. So remember this: the food is amazing, the country is hot and the people are beautiful. From the northern capital city of Hanoi, to the green and airy central coast of Hoi An and finally down to the bustling metropolis of Ho Chi Minh City, we were in awe of every single second that granted us the undeniable privilege that it was to savor each cultural and culinary moment while being enveloped in its centuries old history and grandeur. Street food, night markets, museums, landmarks, Michelin restaurants, bars and massages = eat, sleep, repeat. As fast paced as some of these cities might have been, it was a reminder to really appreciate all I have in life and to approach it much slower. Cheers and thank you Vietnam 🇻🇳 #vietnam #vietnamtravel

What a fun birthday weekend! This gorgeous gift was delayed due to the snow and arrived today instead of before or on my birthday but definitely worth the wait. However, the best gift I received was the fact that we were offered by Koko’s family to adopt her and said yes!!! She’s now my full time snuggle bug and partner in crime. I was actually supposed to work on my birthday but icy roads had me stuck at home for two days and was rescued by friends with chains and took Koko hiking up a mountain to go sledding down the slopes followed by some well needed bowl of hot noodles. I’ve never had snow fall on my birthday and have typically spent it somewhere tropical but due to school and work, I guess I’ll have to wait until spring break to get those tan lines. Cheers and thanks for the love! ❤️ 👜 🐶 🏔️ 🛷 🍜

I normally would never travel to the Midwest, I mean, they call it the “flyover states” for a reason right? However, back in February I celebrated my birthday by traveling through Colombia 🇨🇴. It was in Medellin at the rooftop bar of the hostel I was staying in where I heard two American accents talking and laughing in the corner. So I walked over and immediately asked, “Are you guys American?” and that was when I met Kirsten and Nelson, two amazing people also traveling through Colombia from Minnesota. We ended up spending the remaining days of my trip doing tours and excursions together, grabbing drinks and dinner each night and even following 2 locals to a seedy locals only nightclub in some random warehouse and dancing until 5 am. They were the best part of my trip that’s for sure. We remained in touch and vowed to visit each other in our home states and even talked about seeing a Portland Timber’s versus Minnesota United soccer game together. And so that’s exactly what I did. I flew to Minnesota, met more amazing mid-westerners, ended up at a random house party with an awesome girl that I met having dinner at the bar of a delicious James Beard award winning restaurant and danced until 4 am, climbed the roof of this amazing loft apartment building, gazed at the Midwest stars, woke up and went to the Timber’s vs Minnesota match, took shots with strangers who are also fellow Portlanders that were in town for the game, went to an awesome dinner in St. Paul with these beautiful faces and then we all proceeded to dance the night away. And that, is how I ended up flying to a flyover state for the first time. 

Moral of the story: make those connections, talk to those people sitting at the bar next to you, take shots with random strangers even if you’re the only 5 people representing Portland in an all Minnesota United bar. Befriend those who you otherwise would have never met and keep in touch with them. But whatever you do, always leave a beautiful lasting impression on those you meet. 🖤

I miss Thailand! I really want to do another trip back there while I also eat my way through the surrounding countries but I hear that the requirements to getting their right now are pretty strict and rightfully so. Luckily for me, Portland is dotted with a ton of Thai restaurants throughout the city and @khaomoodang just so happens to be my new favorite one! 

The signature dish (pictured in the middle) which is also their namesake, is one of the best I’ve ever had: crispy pork with Chinese sausage and a delicious sweet yet tangy sauce (moo-dang) over rice. But my hands down ultimate favorite over theirs is the house curry noodle dish which comes with the same five spiced pork loin, crispy pork belly, whole boiled egg but with egg noodles in a spicy khao soi curry 👊🏾 (also available with tofu). 

Yes, I still have a work out trainer on retainer and no I do not plan on telling him what I ate this week let alone allow him to follow me on this account. Do yourself a favor and indulge in this new year. #khaomoodang #thaifood #pdxeats #kalaniateit
Cheers 2021, you got me! What an amazing year! I can’t even count or name all the places I went but I know I had an amazing moment every step of the way!🥂 #2021 #newyear #nye #2021recap #reels #reelsforrealz #reelsinstagram #reel #travel

I named these two PooPoo and Baby after my 2 childhood dogs who lived long and happy lives until they went off to doggy paradise. The sad fact is that only 1 in 1,000 sea turtle hatchlings will make it to adulthood. And although I knew and understood this while nervously watching these 2 beautiful newly hatched creatures begin their arduous journey of clumsily making their way towards the crashing waves of the endless ocean, my heart palpitating as I constantly surveyed the land and sky for potential predators until they finally disappeared beyond the depths of the blue; I kept imagining what will be the most beautiful, long and peaceful lives that they will live. Cause to be this innocent, vulnerable and endangered only to have to start life with so many challenges and odds already against you and then not even make it is the most sad and courageous way to have ever lived and that should never be an option for anything or anybody.

Paradise called, it said quit your day job. 😉📞🏝
Is the heat wave finally over? Was that even a heat wave tho (compared to the 116 degrees June 29th). Whatever it was, I think most of us were actually excited to wake up to cloudy skies today as I know we can all use a little reprieve from the heat. Spent the day cart-hopping and showing some love to some food carts as all the cart operators have been forced to close on these high heat days losing out on business. Hopefully we can all show them some love. Also spent the day park-hopping with Koko. Found out she hates slides (➡️) and that my fat ass gets stuck half-way thru and has to scoot the rest of the way down. Summer lovin’ had me a blast. #pdxeatsnow #pdxeats #pdx #foodcart
Another gorgeous day spent chillin’ in the warm sun, sand and swimming which means another beautiful evening for a delicious dinner in the backyard. It’s barbecue season and while it’s my island birthright to effectively know how to master a grill, I don’t actually own one yet and quite honestly, I just prefer to just have all that already prepared for me.

Cue in @lawlessbbq a new kid on the block giving everybody a run for there money while dishing up some sweet and smoky Kansas City style bbq located just east of the river in the SE industrial blocks. I’m gonna go ahead say it: this is one of the best bbq joints in Portland - and finally, something else besides the constant overhyped spots in this city!🥴 Juicy, tender, slow cooked smoked pork spare ribs that nearly melt off the bone only to be rivaled by the prime angus brisket that you can cut with a spoon. I also ordered the brisket burnt ends cause, fuck, why not?! Paired that with a plethora of amazing side dishes like loaded potato salad, mac and cheese with panko crust, bbq beans topped with smoked meats and crispy onions and vinegar coleslaw 👊🏾 And while I’ll always without a doubt favor island bbq (especially my moms) over anything else, this is legit what summer should taste like. #kansascitybbq #bbq #portland #pdxeats
What do you do after spending the entire afternoon day drinking, swimming and lounging by the water? Eat of course. It’s no different from what I would do if I were down in Mexico right now. I’d walk to my favorite Rosticería, order a whole chicken (cut to order) add additional sides of those delicious papas with the drippings from the slowly cooked chickens, go to the rooftop pool and have an amazingly cheap dinner while watching the sunset before meeting  up with friends to drink the night away only to rinse and repeat the next day. Sadly I’m currently not in Mexico and this delicious chicken dinner from @pollonorteportland is not nearly as authentic as standing in line on the side of a Mexican street corner and breathing in those delicious aromas while taking in the amazing culture. However, I’ll accept this to serve as my current substitute and while I may not have the rooftop sunset view, being able to have dinner on a warm summer evening in my beautiful backyard to then lounge with a glass of cold rosé is not so bad. A gringos paradise if you will.

STOP! Before you keep scrolling, please enjoy this moment of my best friend Koko sitting eye level at the patio table outside of a restaurant patiently waiting for her dinner as I was also doing the same. Just wanted to let you know that underbites are not only cute but unique, shaggy hair is acceptable and belly rubs are key! 🐶 otay...keep scrolling.#dogsofinstagram
Had a craving for chicken and waffles and knew there was only 1 place that would be able to satisfy that craving. So I popped over to @fishfusion_pdx (they’re actually known more for their fish) a black female owned and operated food cart on NE MLK and ordered the 8 pc. wings which come with 2 waffles. The wings themselves are tossed in Stephanie’s delicious house blend of seasonings then fried with a nice crunchy skin while the crisp yet airy waffles are made fresh to order from her homemade batter. I ordered an additional 2 more waffles and savored every single bite. As mentioned, she’s very well known for her signature “fish on a stick” as is well known for selling out. So my advice, get there early. 🍗 🧇 🤤

Balls because I’m Gay, as if you didn’t already know...and because Pride is cancelled again this year (in Portland anyway). Apparently pizza is an option now which has clearly brought out some thirsties from the “swipe right” hungry bitches. But back in my gay “hay” day, you were either team balls or team pizza 🍕. I’m so glad to live in a growing society where people can have an option to choose both. But balls all the way...it’s just saltier and spicier. Dont @ me. @24thpizzaandmeatballs
The culinary talent in this “City of Roses” continues to emanate with not only the creative veterans who have established their names and early-on legacies but also have allowed a growing space for the next generation of new forces to once again identify and then re-identify the constant ebbing and flowing of Portland’s iconic food scene - one that is consistently distinguished and recognized across our divided nation: a trialed time for not just this community, but the entire globe. Food should always bring us together.

What happens when you pair the mind behind former beloved restaurant, Tabla who’s also the man responsible for every stoners favorite other “joint” 24th & Meatballs, as well as the incredible talent of a powerful young female chef with a resumé that includes not only a James Beard award winning restaurant but also another restaurant that could easily garner a Michelin star (if they ever decide to include the PNW)? You get @montelupomarket an Italian market and restaurant that serves traditional handmade noodles while also operating as a neighborhood market with fresh made grab-n-go items, pantry essentials and even delicious desserts in the former bar and pizza shop once operated by the lead singer of Modest Mouse. Yeah, definitely a scene out of Portlandia, but this power duo and their team are whipping up some damn good house-made noodles and offering it at a very modest $12 per plate average and with filling portions, a combination that’s seemingly hard to find in a city that is steadily seeing a steep incline in food and rent prices. The team have also created a comfortable outdoor dining space and is operating it 7-nights a week (a rarity for restaurants nowadays) as well as take-out. I opted for the latter as nothing pairs better with delicious pasta than dining in the comfort of your own backyard. Order 1 of everything, chill down a couple bottles of your favorite rosé, invite some vaccinated friends over and enjoy the moment. 🍝
Had a surprisingly amazing and unique dining experience last night at @de_fuego_grille I say surprising because this delicious yet unassuming restaurant is somewhat hidden inside the very modest Monarch Hotel located about 11 miles outside of Portland proper in the suburb of Clackamas. To be honest, I had never heard of De Fuego and further I rarely ever leave the city to venture out to the burbs so I was quite shocked when I read about the amazing Latin American inspired dishes paired by their hand-crafted cocktails with the food menus being curated by a 25 year old female chef - you would automatically think that this would be a 4-night a week, reservation only, sold out pop-up concept located somewhere in NE or SE Portland. But there it stood, next door to a Target on the side of a Chic-Fil-A down the street from the gleaming lights of many more strip malls and fast food chains.

 A word the restaurant industry have come to either embrace, mock or even hate: pivot. Since the initial shut down in 2020, every restaurant, food cart and bar has had to “pivot” to find a new way of being able to survive. From putting thousands of dollars into building new outdoor dining spaces and even old dining spaces to establishing new menus and programs like take-out and delivery. It’s what I call “The Hunger Games”. But no one as of yet have become as creative or smart as the the team behind De Fuego. The owner, who also happens to own the hotel has turned (pivoted) the entire 1st floor of guest hotel rooms to private dining spaces, meaning: for only $10 additional, you can reserve a hotel room now converted dining room complete with: full bar and menu service, your own private restroom (complete with shower) TV, lighting, air conditioning, windows some with views and your own Amazon echo capable of pairing your phone all with the ability to customize your own dining ambiance for 2-hours. Oh yeh, did I mention that the food is amazing, flavorful, filling and affordable? For just 2 people, our entire bill for all these delicious dishes delivered in our own private dining “world” came out to be $60 per person. Check them out!

All I wanted was a hot air balloon ride over one of the most beautiful archaeological sites I’ve ever been too. A couple years ago, I climbed these pyramids and I walked the Avenue of Death after finding a better version of my own self in Mexico City. 
•
This past February, for my birthday, I did a stealth tour and flew to Mexico City and then, flew higher! Way above in a hot air balloon over the beautiful historical site of Teotihuacan. And while It challenged my enormous fear of heights, it also gave me a different perspective of not only the Aztecs who once occupied this pre-Columbian site that dates back to 1 AD to 500 AD, but also how incredibly little my personal challenges may seem. The feeling I felt which I still feel when looking at my personal photos or videos of this day is indescribable. To experience history of life while having so much adrenaline powering through me in that very moment, it was incredible. In short, I loved every second of that fear. Every second of that uncertainty but familiarity at the same time. Every second of this amazing history. 🇲🇽
Rule number 1: after a long day of playing on the beach always remember to bathe your Koko or Koko friend in warm water and 🐶 friendly soap in order to wash all the sand off. 
•
Rule number 2: always remember to throw your bestest most softest blanket into the dryer during the bathing process to heat up and be ready for your Koko or Koko friend after they shower. 🐾 
•
Rule number 3: after you towel dry your Koko or Koko friend, wrap them up nice and tight into that warm soft blanket next to a fireplace and play them soft instrumental music and let them snore away. 🐶 💤 ❤️
🐶: I get it now. 
🤵🏽: What do you get Koko? You’re just a dog! 
🐶: Humans spend so much time proving that they live, that they forget to just live. 
🤵🏽: 💔
I might be a day late to celebrate 3.14 but you didn’t think I only ate pizza on Pi Day did you?  #pizza #piday #za 🍕
Cheers to the real ones...the ones that don’t need to impress...the following without the followers...the loved without the likes...the least so pretty but damn so pretty...the ones in the underbelly for the belly...the true underdogs that define our city. #javierstacoshop #pdxeats
Happy International Women’s Day to my number one - my amazing mom who has done so much to inspire and shape me as the proud young gay man of color that I am. Words and gifts will never be able to pay that love and respect back but I still honor you today and each and every day. And to all of the other strong, courageous, beautiful and powerful women in my life, thank you. ❤️
Don’t forget about the underdogs! It’s great that Portland is in a new phase where dining-in is allowed to happen yet again. Just don’t forget about all of the food pods and food carts that occupy them who have been here for us throughout all of this and had to fight to stay here to continue to take care of us. Thanks for the amazing eats @koreantwist Meat, rice and kimchee...my idea of a good fucking meal! Open daily and located over at @hawthorne_asylum 🙏🏾
A belated thank you to everyone for all of the birthday love sent my way. I kept it very low key with Koko 🐶 and just a few friends - and although I’m now technically “late 30’s” I still feel (and look) as if I’m in my early 30’s. The only difference now is, I finally know my path and I now have a pair of crystal encrusted Jimmy Choo’s to lead me down it. Cheers to finding it all at 37. 🥂
Today feels like the final end to a maniacal tirade and the beginning of a new era. Finally, this country can officially start 2021: a year of hope, healing, honest leadership, community, love, respect and unity.

Thank you to my friends @sistersgourmetdelipdx for these awesome yet understated (😂) custom made chocolate covered strawberries which is just a small example of the amazing work they can do for any of your special occasion needs, holidays, or even just a random Wednesday January the 20th. Not too mention, they’re a full on gourmet deli with an an extensive menu filled with delicious soups, salads and sandwiches like the Italian Grinder ➡️ (which is not a gay pun for anything). But what I really love and respect about Michaela and Nick is their ongoing work and commitment to building a stronger community. Wether it be working tireless hours during the pandemic to purchase supplies to feed hospital personnel and other frontline workers, raising and matching donations to support black organizations, using their platform and restaurant space to highlight other women or minority owned businesses to just being overall kind and caring human beings who are true leaders in their community. Small business owners who seem to use their voice and time to lift others and are not afraid to stand for what’s right no matter what the cost. Imagine if the big businesses in this city followed the same example. Check them out and let’s give them the full support they’ve been giving to all of us. 👏🏾👏🏾#fucktrump #sistersgourmetdeli
I’m not sure if Koko is a fan of her new portrait or not but I do know that she enjoyed plenty of animal crackers which I had to use to coerce her in to sitting next to her photo. If someone asked me what I would save from my house in a fire, it wouldn’t be all the amazing art and artifacts I’ve collected, it would be this very real and amazing illustration of Koko...and a case of White Claw...and my Mariah Carey memorabilia. 🐶
I deactivated news notifications on my phone and have only been going on to social media to upload and archive moments which will become memories from this time in Mexico. It’s hard to be depressed or angry about whatever is happening in the US when you’re in a gorgeous historic city like Guanajuato. The multicolored buildings, homes and Spanish architecture are hypnotizing and it is certainly the most beautiful city I have ever been too. Situated in a narrow valley, this UNESCO World Heritage Site is made up of a labyrinth of narrow alleyways that wind intricately throughout the city. In fact, most of the city is inaccessible to cars due to how narrow and steep the roads and alleys are and so they utilize a maze of tunnels below the city which was used to funnel the flow of the Guanajuato river until they built a dam to contain the city from flooding. 
•
This is definitely a city intended for you to get lost in and explore the many hidden gems that greet you out of nowhere. I would wander around through as many as I could and pop into random galleries or museums that I happened upon while grabbing a coffee and some street food down another or a refreshing drink at a roof top bar that ended up in my path or sitting on a nearby bench with an agua fresca and just admiring the city and the people passing by. Do yourself a favor: travel to Guanajuato, put some music in your ears and lose yourself through the winding streets and alleys of this city. Cause sometimes you just need to get lost to find yourself. 🙏🏾🇲🇽 #guanajuato
Dear San Miguel de Allende, 
I’m writing you this letter to thank you for your amazing beauty, your rich history, charming cobblestone streets, friendly people, delicious food, amazing art and genuine hospitality. From you’re strength to being the first city in Mexico to gain it’s independence to you’re preservation of culture and respect, I’m so in awe of every aspect of you and have learned so much in these several days and I’m forever grateful to be able to share your story with the paths of those, many or few, that I may cross. Gracias por tú corazón. 🙏🏾🤎🇲🇽#sanmigueldeallende #mexico
How do I put into words the beauty of this amazing church. It’s quite impossible really.l, I’m just stunned. Dating back to the 17th century you can feel from its dominating presence and its gorgeous ornate detailing inside the walls that there is a defined sense of history and energy here which serves as the beating heart of beautiful San Miguel de Allende, a UNESCO World Heritage Site that is the very birthplace of the Mexican independence. Imagine, the thousands upon thousands of lives through the many centuries that filled these pews praying for blessings, independence, peace, love. 🙏🏾🧡 #sanmigueldeallende #guanajuato
Koko’s annual visit to her favorite farm and pumpkin patch @bellaorganicfarm was another success and such a fun relaxing way to spend a gorgeous sunny day. We roamed the massive property, hung out with the goats and pigs from @heart2heartfarm ,bought plenty of pumpkins for the house, got our favorite hand made jams, syrups and vinaigrette and of course, enjoyed their amazing apple and blackberry hard cider. We didn’t do their intricate and huge corn maze this trip (cause it was so damn hot out) which is an ode and a thank you to essential workers, but we do plan on coming back before the season is over to get lost in the maze, eat homemade cookies and drink more cider. 
•
A huge thank you to my girl Sophia, her husband, their family and the entire Bella Organic Farm team for their ensured efforts of making this place clean, safe and sanitized for all of us to come out and enjoy our time searching for the perfect pumpkins while having a memorable visit. As I’ve said in past, this is our favorite farm and we love coming here specifically because it’s not only Koko 🐶 friendly but everyone makes you feel welcomed and like you’re part of the family. 🎃 🌽🙏🏾
It’s as if we cannot seem to catch a break. What is currently happening in our world, our societies, cities and communities as well as the beautiful Pacific Northwest Region is utterly devastating and it’s really hard to describe in words. So many amazing Portland restaurants have shuttered due to the craziest curve ball that’s been pitched and for the few that are still trying to play in this game, their concepts, livelihoods and team are left with, what’s next? The fires that are engulfing the luscious green landscape and wildlife that Oregon is so loved for has created extensive damage beyond repair and while we’re all hoping for rain, that smoke that billows through the entire state have now once again affected the lives of so many restaurant workers forcing many operations to once again close their doors. Simply put, they need you. It’s a strange time to be outside, but we cannot rebuild or communities, our beloved institutions, our homes and our respect for one another if we don’t try. 
•
Oregonians are known for their kindness and we can certainly use plenty of it right now. If you have an extra bottle of water in your car give it to someone on the street, small simple things, but do what you can to help the many in need who have fled their homes, jobs and lives to try to stay in this game. Safely go out and support these small business and people who need us. You might just stumble upon one of the best tacos you’ve had outside of Mexico. 🤎🙏🏾

I love apartment living especially in the NW District of Portland where it’s all historic buildings. I’ve spent the past 3-4 years of my life in an amazing Victorian style home converted to apartments and one special thing that I have which is a rarity on NW 23rd is a balcony. During the “initial covid pandemic”, I had to really come up with a way of designing an ulterior space that gives me a moment to break away yet be a part of the community, a place where we can have tea in the morning, sandwiches in the afternoon, champagne and wine in the evening, while making it Koko friendly and still be able to see friends walk by and patiently anticipate that amazon package. I’m gonna miss my balcony. But happy to have a new backyard at the new house to invite you all over.
What I’ll miss most when I move out of the NW District is jian bing from @bing.mi Of course the stars would align only for me to un-align? (Is that even a word) #jianbing #bingmipdx

How is everyone? I feel like we’ve all been moving so swiftly and it’s close to the close of summer and I just wanted to check in. I hope that we’ve all been able to take a moment to be thankful for the opportunity to continue to tell and share our life stories with the world, considering the fact there are so many that sadly, cannot. As a reminder, It costs nothing to be selfless. An “I’m doing great thank you for asking, and how about yourself?” Really goes a long way. Compassion is infectious and sexy. Hope we come out from a time of reflection to have a better empathy for one and another. Drinks on me after we pull it together. 🙏🏾
About 3 months ago today, I flew to Salt Lake City, Utah for the first time ever in my life and for a haircut. The state of Oregon was in Phase Zero, which meant all the barbershops were still closed and we were all walking around looking like hairy ass zombies. I boarded the flight, caught their tram into the city, grabbed some lunch from @evasbakery and went to the state Capitol and sat on the grounds and enjoyed a delicious sandwich while I waited for my hair appointment only 1 mile away downtown. I jumped on a scooter after lunch, popped into @bureaubarberandshop for a slick fade, grabbed a drink at a bar next door (that’s an interesting thing to do in a Mormon state) went shopping at Nordstrom and boarded a plane 2 hours later back to Portland. Freshly faded, full and shopping bags in tow, my only regret is never seeing an actual lake in Salt Lake. ✈️
My love for Vallarta is based on its simplicity: Simple life, simple food, simple people but with a vibrant culture and stellar views. Take this cubana torta for example; bread, meat, chunks of cheese and sauce all for $1.50 USD and prepared by 2 amazing Mexican women humbly operating their 4-table cafe that is mainly frequented by locals alike, all popping in for a home cooked breakfast to start their day, or a torta to-go on their lunch break. There’s a small language barrier between Sandy her sister and I which is the fault of mine for not fully learning their native tongue but is certainly something I am constantly working on. One things is certain, however, as I’ve continued to develop a friendly relationship with these 2 women, I am constantly grateful for their big smiles and warm greetings every time I step inside their cafe. I like to think that they’re just as happy to see me as I am to see them. The amazing food is just a bonus.
I don’t need to be remembered for anything, just know that I did something. #kalanididit
How is it that people in the states are just now discovering Tacos Dorados de Birria? Is this because most people in the US enjoy their tacos in a hard shell (hard pass 😒), served out of a drive-thru window at a Taco Bell which sadly to many is considered authentic and the definition of what Mexican street food is, and also for some reason this “cultural” exploration is reserved to be enjoyed exclusively on Tuesdays? Americans ruin everything 😒 Whatever your basic ass excuse is, this delicious combination of crispy meaty pockets of heaven paired with that warm, savory and slightly spicy stew has been around for many generations. Traditionally, these sets are both typically prepared with goat meat and usually only served on special occasions and holidays like birthdays and Christmas. But what if I told you I knew of an authentic place that serves this highly anticipated dish all year long and is actually located in Jalisco, at a 4 table hole-in-the wall restaurant hidden in plain sight on the bustling cobble stoned one-way streets of Vallarta’s Old Town District. And get this, the name of the this place is...Tacos de Birria. Listen, you don’t name your restaurant after one specific dish unless you’re damn sure you know that dish is fucking good. And guess what, it fucking is. 👊🏾
When the sun shines on you, you’re a fool to turn away. 🧡
Why was I so nervous about posting this experience? I’ll tell you why, because certain people made me feel intimidated and uncomfortable about traveling during Covid to where I had to hide the fact that I was traveling or moving about and continuing to living my own life during this pandemic and another Civil Rights Movement. Why I felt like I needed to hide or apologize for me having the personal right to do what I want, was bullshit. I know now, that I should not ever have to feel that way. I don’t own anyone an apology for living my life as carefully, safely and freely as I want.

Anyhow, I flew to Seattle from Portland on June 10th to support black owned businesses and specifically came up here to dine at @fatschicken which is an amazing restaurant located in the Central District (or what me and my friends used to call the “CD” when I used to live not too far away on East 26th and Roy in my early 20’s) to feast on some locally renowned chicken and waffles. I woke up early, took a Lyft to the airport, went through TSA, boarded a 30 minute flight to SeaTac airport, took a train to downtown Seattle, walked up hill to the CD, got to the restaurant and ordered chicken and waffles and ate it at a random park down the street and it was the best, tasty fucking decision I’ve made in the past several months. 🧇 + 🍗 = 🤤 #supportblackbusiness
Finally got a chance to meet Tai and Annie, the amazing duo behind the hot new waffle cart @duopdx located in the SW downtown area right by PSU. If you remember in March when Portland shut down as covid began its wrath, Tai was handing out free bowls of pozole from his porch to anyone who was in need just looking for a warm meal. That generosity and sense for community would push them 1 step further into opening their own food cart in the midst of a crazy pandemic where they would once again use their kindness and compassion to donate proceeds earned to Black Lives Matter causes proving that this duo team is all about their community and that even through food, you can protest and do just as much to help others versus remaining visibly and vocally silent like so many companies have decided to do. People will always remember the ones who stood by and did nothing. Remember that.

I went with the Tai burger, named after Chef Tai himself a fun play on words and ingredients with: ground beef, Thai peanut sauce, pickle, bacon, onion jam and cheddar cheese sandwiched between to made-to-order crispy and sweet waffles. Napkin level = 15. I was rushing to make an appointment and scarfed it down on a public street and I have no regrets if there’s a snap chat floating around of some rando in downtown sloppily shoving a waffle burger in his face while yelling at a pigeon. Get down here and visit this amazing duo of hearts and support them as they support the community. 🧇 🍔 ✊🏾
I took a couple days away from constantly being on/checking social media. I know now is an important time to NOT stay silent and that we need to continue to push the message of this movement that black lives matter. However, I found myself becoming emotionally outraged by what I was reading and seeing that I myself began to create negative energy which I could tell had the potential to affect others with the ability to cause more damage than heal or repair, that I needed to pause and process a better way of being able to help educate and share without isolating or by feeding more negative energy into this world. As I was reminded so eloquently yesterday, “you don’t have to clock-in to protest”. If you can protest and speak about it in your way that is positively valuable to others, than by all means, speak up and dammit speak loudly. 🗣

I was fortunate to stop by and visit @jadassoulfuleatz food cart who is owned by Larry and Jamie, an acquaintance of mine, and when they’re not wining and dining themselves around the city in support of local businesses, they’re dishing up signature soul food dishes like fried pork ribs and yams, and as my luck would have it they were out of the fried ribs. So Jamie herself suggested another dish that they’re well known for, buttermilk fried chicken, and I’m so glad she did. Plump, crispy, juicy and tender are not just the correct adjectives in describing my new found covid body, but it’s also how I would explain her amazing boneless chicken. Pair that with their mac-n-cheese and end it with a generous helping of her banana pudding and you’ve got yourself one damn good meal warmly prepared by an amazing local family. Get there fast, they sell out! 🙏🏾 #supportblackbusinesses
Posting a black square isn’t doing anything but stopping the conversation of so many innocent black voices that have been silenced. We need to tell their stories! We all have a platform and an opportunity to utilize it to educate one another, listen to the stories of black people and amplify them. Support black artists, support black businesses, support black lives. 
There’s a list of local black owned businesses and restaurants of Portland floating around on social media encouraging people to support them which is a beautiful thing, but I can’t help but notice that this list is not only unsurprisingly short but only surfaces anytime there’s an uprising over another death of an innocent black life. Why are these businesses constantly forgotten otherwise? Don’t pick and choose convenient times for you to do a “one time deed” or post MLK Jr. quotes to make yourself feel better, that’s not how we dismantle hate and police brutality. Support black businesses and entrepreneurs daily. 
Thank you to Randy, owner of  @poboyzfoodcart located downtown which is one of the very few black owned businesses located in this area who continues to stay open daily amidst covid and curfews. Randy’s only been open 1 year and is hoping he can move his operation to brick-n-mortar soon. Let’s make that dream happen for him and continue to make more room and space for more black voices, black community leaders and black owned businesses to thrive and be successful in this city. And yes, his po boy sandwiches are bomb as they look. Order the hot-honey chicken with a side of fried pickle slices and grab 10 napkins. 🔥
Is it too late? Did I miss “National Burger Day”? I know this isn’t a local burger and I’m proud to say that Portland is home to some amazing burger spots but this is my 2-for-1 post for burger day and throwback Thursday. So let’s throw it back to this duo of delicious double doubles I had at @innout in February after an entire day at Disneyland (shout out to my boys Donald & Goofey). Fun fact: I recently waited 2.5 hours in a drive-thru line at the Keizer, OR location for this same order, cause burgers, amirite!? 🍔🍔
#firstworldproblem alert. Sad fact: I was supposed to return back to Asia in July but this time take a tour of India and its amazing culture, art, history and of course the food. I know that there are bigger problems we are facing around the world but I just needed a brief moment to pout. I also know that I will eventually make my way there someday soon, but until that time comes, I’ll just be exploring India via YouTube while stuffing my face with local Indian street food around the city. Don’t sleep on @dhaba_indian_kitchen located in the brand new food pod @nobhillfoodcarts_pdx that we finally got in what is arguably the best neighborhood (my hood) the NW District. They were previously downtown by PSU but are now calling this brand new pod home. I ate it on my balcony and squinted my eyes to pretend that I was sitting in front of the Taj Mahal...spoiler alert: the food was amazing, my makeshift Taj, well, not so much. #supportlocal 🙏🏾💜
Just a reminder that my favorite family owned and operated Korean fast food restaurant @bibi2go_pdx just reopened today for take out and delivery and you can imagine my excitement when I found out that they’re still offering their delicious Dae Ji Bulgogi (sweet and spicy) and their hand-rolled Kim Bap which is my favorite Korean snack. It’s the perfect comfort food for any day and we can certainly all use a little comfort.💜 #supportlocal #supportsmallbusiness
There’s a reason why food will never taste as good as a mother’s home cooking.  Why so many dishes that we eat now can’t even come close or compare to the versions that she made us growing up. More often than not we eat something that somehow suddenly reminds us of our mom’s cooking and then undoubtedly our oh so true brain silently mumbles, “mom’s is much better!” In some ways, I find myself seeking out food that reminds me of my moms cooking even though I always come to the same conclusion that it’s just not the same. It’s as if the person in your life that is supposed to love, comfort, support and lead you to success essentially set your palette up for failure, and I mean that as a compliment. Is ‘made with a mother’s love’ really an actual ingredient only they have access too? Is this but only one of the many super powers that all mom’s share across the universe: the power to make delicious foods that will remind us of them our entire lives while having their words of wisdom, advice and sometimes scolding criticism constantly billow through every aromatic scent and crunch and savory bite of those unmatched flavors while constantly guiding us to make better decisions in life as if they were right there on your shoulder? There really is nothing like a home cooked meal is there?

As an islander kid growing up my mom made everything fresh and always cooked a feast each night in the event that we had visitors stop by but mainly so that no one ever went to bed with not enough, its an islander thing. My favorite was her BBQ. And while I am still trying to convince her and my dad to open up an Island BBQ restaurant or at the very least a food truck to keep them busy during retirement, I’ll leave you with this char-grilled delicious carnivorous feast my mom made for when I went home recently to visit during the holidays...cause yes, Islander Mom’s barbecue all year long even in the dead of winter. Happy Mother’s Day Mom! Love you!
Xuemei Simard is a fucking bad ass with her heritage of traditional chinese hand pulled noodles - no seriously, she hand pulls every noodle order (swipe left) at her very modest food cart in downtown located a stones throw away from Portland’s underrepresented China Town. It is here and most all areas of Portland where you can see and sense the uncertainty which is the ongoing fate of the food cart industry looming over many cart owners like that of a typical dark cloud would in this City of Roses. As recently as last year, one of Portland’s main downtown food pod was ripped from the community only to make way for the location of the Pacific Northwests’ first ever Ritz Carlton hotel, a shady power play created by the old money “Movers and Breakers” that run this city and gutted the close-knit food community sending many migrant cart owners scrounging for affordable real estate in an attempt to rebuild, many of whom sadly, met their fate. This extraordinary move not only dented the identity that which Portland’s food culture has become synonymous around the world for but it sent the many cultural backgrounds who were already struggling to find success and operate in this city two more steps back. 
Xuemei however, presses on and brings authenticity, respect and hard work daily to share her long standing Chinese tradition of dynasty and history - right there I sat window side in awe of her bad assery, stretching, tossing and shaping the noodle from instinct, heart and soul. She’s not here for fan fare, does not operate a social media account and could probably care less about how many ‘likes’ she gets, a mentality that is all parts refreshing and certainly missed in today’s social media driven society.  But what she does care about is providing her customers the highest quality product that her weathered hands can produce and to share with you through her delicious food stories of her Chinese descent. Incredible. 💜 #supportlocal #supportsmallbusiness
This past weekend I saw first hand what community looks like and the chaotic beauty of what happens when people come together. Ever since I moved to Portland 10 years ago and started working for a small local family owned business, it completely changed my perspective of what it means to support local and the effect you can have on the community. From the way I dine, shop and even travel, I am very conscious of spending my money which is mainly towards local operators, the under dogs if you will. Small businesses don’t get the same luxuries that big corporations do as we’re being reminded of during this time. We have to fight to stay in the game, we have to bend, spend and trend differently than the big boys and most of the time that’s not enough. These small businesses who are currently open and still trying to survive have no other choice too as many of them have employees and families relying on them. A friend of mine ( @michaelamcvetty ) who owns a small restaurant said it the absolute best: “remember when the Titanic was sinking and the band kept playing, well, we’re the band.” Right now, there are plenty of bands playing a big concert to a small audience and I just wanted to remind everyone that there is some really good music that you should listen to right now. Let’s continue to keep them playing long after this over. 
I finally checked out @titosburritosmexicanflavor which is located right by PSU. I’ll go ahead and say these are the best and most authentic tacos I’ve found in Portland so far. My favorite was the Machaca with egg and shredded beef. So damn good! They have a special Mon-Friday from 3-6 where you can get chicken or carnitas tacos for $1 each if you order 3. I ended up getting 3 carnitas and then 3 other tacos as well for good measure - I took them to the park and savored each bite. It was like I was back in Mexico City - the sounds of the hustle in Chapultepec Park: street vendors selling delicious foods and souvenirs and a 35 year old me spontaneously sitting in the middle of this massive city with an enormous appetite for authentic culture and Mexican food and a heart fueled by curiosity and gratitude. #supportlocal 💜
We really have no other choice but too...thank you to the Portland community for still being you! Weird, amazing, community and strong. We must move onward and keep one another safe. #rosecity #portland
While we should continue to take every precaution for the safety of not just ourselves and those who are at higher risk, we shouldn’t forget about our communities. And part of that is to continue to support them - the hospitality industry is taking a big hit with this right now as most operators are losing business day by day and for the sheer safety of their staff and communities, many are making the tough decision to shutter until further notice. There are many ways to continue to help: a lot of restaurants/carts are still offering delivery services through different platforms, offering to-go services through the store itself, and gift cards are always available to purchase for future visits. If you’re practicing safe measures and feel healthy enough to be out and about while adhering to those necessary precautions, then support the businesses that are still open. They all need us right now. People are out panic buying basic essentials yet people in the food and beverage industry are slowly losing their livelihoods and the ability for them to even consider purchasing those basic essentials are becoming a real panic..
🍗
We drove across the city to Cartlandia and went to @msts_foodcart for the first time to indulge on her famous fried chicken and let me tell you, the rumors are true ya’ll!!! 4-pieces of juicy crispy golden brown bone out strips paired with crinkle cut fries, mac-n-cheese and cornbread for $13.95. Sat in the sun, conversed with friends and just enjoyed the beauty that is Portland. Neighbors graciously greeting one another, food cart operators trading food, and fat asses like me deliciously grubbing while supporting our community. Stay safe out there. 🙏🏾
Still thinking about that amazing birthday dinner we had at hip eatery @playgrounddtsa which is located in Santa Ana’s up and coming downtown district. This food and cocktail (we had mocktails) focused establishment seems as if it were almost a mirage in an area surrounded by strip malls and the glowing neon red and yellow lights of In-N-Out. Here, you’ll find literally something for everyone with culinary inspired delights reflecting Asia, Mexico, Italy and beyond. An extensive menu that not only satisfies the carnivorous palate but that of the herbivore as well with almost a section of the menu dedicated to plant foodies. But you’ll wanna grab a stack of napkins and order Uncle Lou’s ‘Famous’ Fried Chicken - that’s right, the same one featured multiple times on the @foodnetwork hailing from restaurant Uncle Lou’s in Memphis. Word is, Lou himself shared his recipe with chef/owner Jason Quinn. It’s the one item printed on the menu that “you can’t send back” and also exclaims “if you don’t know what you’re getting yourself into get something else.” How is it you ask? Let’s just say I’d fly back down just for this chicken, oh and another ride on Disney’s Splash Mountain. Don’t sleep on the Kurobuta Pork Sugo with housemade pasta, whipped ricotta and herbed breadcrumbs. In fact from their pasta to their bread, most of everything here is house made or locally sourced, a bonus for people like me that enjoy fresh quality ingredients while supporting local communities. •
So ditch those kids at Disneyland and allow Chef Quinn and his team to take your tastebuds on a wild ride that even Mickey would get a fast pass for.
I have to say that this was probably one of my favorite birthdays so far. I hung out with all of my childhood friends from smooching with Snoopy,  goofing around with Goofy, daydreaming with Donald, playing with my pal Pluto to finally meeting Mickey. We got soaked on splash mountain, screamed on space mountain, conquered my fears on ghost rider (Knotts Berry farm), waited 9 hours to ride the exclusive Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance all the while feasting on corn dogs, dole whip and ice cream. All my childhood dreams came true at 36. And now I know that the true key to staying young is to always remember to be a kid. 👦🏽
Is 36 still technically mid 30’s? I guess when you get closer to 40 the old saying of “age ain’t nothing but a number” really starts to draw meaning. I don’t feel any different from 35, except that I have an even more burning desire to continue to travel, learn more about the world and everyone and everything in it while discovering more about who I am and what my destiny ultimately in this lifetime is. And while I may have a very small idea of what that may be, I’m gonna set all those big adult thoughts to the side for this week so that I can remind myself that part of getting wiser is to continue to see the magic and allow yourself to be a kid again. Brb, heading down to Disneyland, Knotts Berry Farm, and California Adventure...cause 36 doesn’t mean you get to stop having fun! 🎡 🎉 🎈🎊 #birthdaytrip
We can go on and on about how fried chicken cultivated a different culture of the ever growing food scene here in Portland and fuck, even the nation (talkin’ bout you @popeyeslouisianakitchen ) but why are we so surprised that something so simple can mean so much? We never made fried chicken growing up in my family cause islanders love to barbecue, but we did have nights growing up where my mom didn’t wanna cook (rightfully so) and treated us to @kfc and Popeyes’s and it became a tradition for us: gathering around the table of a 20 pc family meal with sides and big hot pot of white rice and spices and enjoying what I took for granted - that developing love of my family and culture. I’m glad that everyone is finding their peace in a piece of fried chicken, whatever that needs to be for you. Continue to let simple things bring your energy, spirit and hunger to the table and create dialogue with those seated next to you. Bring some napkins and all the sauces babies, there’s plenty a room for all of us. @basiliskpdx isn’t a metaphor for anything, but it has some damn good #friedchicken
Going home for the after holiday. 1st time in years that I’ve been home with family. Brb, flying to Seattle!
Respect when respect is due! Did you know that @hubers.portland.or is the oldest restaurant in @portland which dates back to 1897 ultimately being purchased by Frank Huber in 1910? It’s also one of the only restaurants in all of Oregon and maybe even the entire world (my claim) where you can get a traditional turkey dinner all year long with all the standard fixings! Sometimes I come here in the summer with cravings for a thanksgiving dinner cause they always got you set with: turkey, ham, mashed potatoes, stuffing, gravy, hot rolls and cranberry sauce with pumpkin pie at the end...all year long! Basically, it’s holiday season all day everyday up in this restaurant and really the only thing missing to make it reminiscent and complete of your own personal holiday is your drunk aunt taking her wig off twerking table side to no music while being side eyed by your conservative grandmother staring at you wondering why you’re still single and hopeless...awkward, was that a snippet of my childhood revealed, or yours? #holidays #hubers #huberscafe #turkeydinner #twerk
I keep thinking about Guadalajara, and what I learned and who I met. I formed so many amazing friendships with people there while exploring the city. But my last night there still stands out. I went back to the same bar down the street from my @airbnb and hung out with friends that I made till the early morning. I was hungry and was told about many of street food on Chapultepec but to take caution whilst navigating down that street that late of night as it is was dangerous. My liquid courage and hunger disregarded the words of advice and ultimately led me to Jorge who was silently cooking on the dark avenue with only 2 other patrons in sight. I drunkenly stumbled on to my words while sloppily holding up my stance and ordered tacos in the best Spanglish that I could create (I was such a tourist). A quirky smile and lowered eyebrows looked at me and said, “you speak English!?” I exclaimed, YES and introduced myself. “My name is Jorge, how hungry are you?” he said. I was hungry! And based off the slurred attempt at Spanish, he told me that he was going to make me his special which was: 2 burger patties that were stuffed with sausage, 4 different cheeses and hot dogs all placed in a bun. I was dumbfounded, seriously stupid in a coma after I ate it. It was the food that had me fucked up, but it was his heart and care for my well being of guiding me back to my Airbnb in the darkness of a Guadalajaran night, that really touched me. He was genuinely concerned about me getting home safe. I still think about Jorge and of course that amazing concoction of a meal. Thank you Jorge. Your natural way of being human and kind to me reached more than you or I could ever imagine. Because I still spread that type of love to this day. 🖤
Kind of wishing we were back in sunny Palm Springs lounging by the pool underneath the hot sun. Or taking an afternoon nap in our king sized bed with the windows wide open to the relaxing sounds of the water fountain center of the private courtyard below the backdrop of the beautiful San Jacinto mountains. Palm Springs, you sure are pretty. 🌴✨ @theinglesideinn .

Off to go celebrate this old man. 👴🏻That’s right, Chris turned 40 last night which in gay years means he’s essentially dead 💀. I asked him what he wanted to do to celebrate and he said he just wanted to lay poolside in the hot sun and go out to dinner just like we did last year. And since we’ve both been working a ton lately and managed to get the next 3-days off, it was perfect timing for us to get out of rainy Portland for some R&R. Still not sure if we’re celebrating his birth or gay death, but if you need us, we’ll be down in sunny Palm Springs celebrating nonetheless. 🌴🧘🏽‍♂️🥂🎉🎊💀

This fall, when koko graduated from one of the top liberal arts colleges in the nation. 🐾 🎓
I never needed a reason to fall in love with Mexico...I just needed a reason to fall in love with life again and how viewing it from a different perspective would teach me that. When I went to Guadalajara last month it was to further explore the music, art and culture of a people I came to understand and respect early on. 72-hours was enough for me to form once again that incredible experience and curiousness in feelings, but alas, 72-hours was not nearly enough for me to fully comprehend the history of this city and the amazing people that call it home. Seeing the sites that I saw and witnessing the inspiring beauty of this culture simply through their historical art gave me more perspective; for it will always be perspective that should respectfully remind us that we are a multidimensional society of people living a humbled existence freely, and it is in that specific meaning of intention that we all somehow connect back as one in the same. •
I fell in love with José Clemente Orozco and his amazing mural art: a prolific Mexican artist often referred to as the Mexican Van Gogh of his time who’s art focused on social realism that spoke to many in different ways of symbolism and often touching on the people versus the government and vice versa. It’s in his work that I connected the dots back to my reality, our reality, and the current affairs that take place in this world. Imagine now, if José Clemente Orozco were here today, what his open and progressive perspective of vision would he prepare and insight our little minds to think; to further push and create a narrative or even ask the well needed questions of what we are thinking and perhaps what we are not thinking or what we should be thinking. Really in the end, he just wanted us to see from a different perspective. 
#joseclementeorozco #museocabañas #hospiciocabañas
Had such an amazing time taking koko to her favorite pumpkin patch and farm on @bellaorganicfarm located on Sauvie Island. We go every year to pick out pumpkins, ride the cow train, see the farm animals, get lost in the corn maze and of course snack on some delicious treats while roaming the property. It’s one of the very few pet friendly farms that actually allows dogs  even through their corn maze as the farm was actually named after the families beloved dog, Bella. Thank you so much to Sophia and the rest of the Bella family and team for your kindness and hospitality, It’s what keeps us coming back. Be sure get here to check out the amazing Rosie the Riveter corn maze they designed and created in honor of all the bad ass history and accomplishments women have made this year! They also have their very spooky haunted corn maze going on now through Halloween! 🎃🌽🍁🐶
Let’s face it, brunch in Portland is a weird and serious thing. People in this city will spend nearly 5 years of their lives waiting in lines for weekend brunch (a statistic that I made up that’s probably true). And while more and more eateries in this city jump on that cash cow bandwagon to serve up some bland ass traditional overpriced eggs benedict and are more concerned on volume over service (it’s Portland after all) to pack in hung over hipsters looking to further induce their hangovers with gimmicky specials like bottomless kombucha mimosas and organic cheeseburger topped bloody mary’s or some shit, there’s 1 spot in Portland that’s made a name for itself in being non-traditional: @hunnymilkpdx Sure, they too have a line getting in on weekends, but because the only basic thing I’ll ever do is stand in line and wait for a Mariah Carey meet and greet (that’s a basic gay right mind you) I came during the week, while all the brunch zombies were slaving at their 9 to 5’s which means no lines and better service.
•
As mentioned, the food here is non traditional brunch fare. Imagine if the worlds best chef [insert whom ever] got super high and had the munchies at 2 am, what would happen next is nothing short of culinary magic: try the rice crispy crusted French toast w/ New York cheesecake schmear, poached rhubarb, watermelon jelly and baby basil. Or see your future in the fortune cookie waffle which is dipped in honey batter w/ vanilla bean mascarpone mousse, raspberry, banana and strawberry drizzle garnished with an actual fortune. My personal favorite was the buttermilk biscuit with chorizo gravy, sunny fried egg, spicy maple syrup and bacon fat wilted spinach = bomb 💣!!! Did I also mention that their menu is a pre-fixed deal and for only $23 you get to choose your choice of a non-booze beverage (get the caramel hot chocolate w/ toasted milk marshmallows) and 1 savory dish and 1 sweet dish which gives you an opportunity to try multiple items at once especially if you bring a friend(s) like I did and eat off their plate too!!! Thanks for the insight to my future team HunnyMilk! (🥠 “your dream will come true when you least expect it.”) #hunnymilk #brunch
Spent a big portion of my afternoon at the Museum of Art which was displaying the Guillermo Del Toro exhibit: En Casa Con Mis Monstrous. It was a collection of his work and fellow artists and horror writers, painters, poets. It also talked about his life growing up as a child in Guadalajara and his curious and imaginative yet scary mind and a much more in depth look into how his vision comes alive on screen. It was definitely one of the best museum exhibits I’ve been too. •
From there I explored the city, took the subway to a massive market, grabbed some tacos, sat in a park and had pastries and continued to sightsee and enjoy the culture and people. This city is so beautiful. 🙏🏾🇲🇽

I’m still in awe of seeing this cathedral that was built in 1867. I’m not religious as most of you know, but I appreciate the beauty in architecture and the energy of the history that something like this breeds. It was moving to say the least. 🙏🏾🇲🇽 .

Did you know that Oregon state was the first state in the U.S to recognize Labor Day as a national holiday? I just found this out recently and it makes sense...we work hard in the beautiful PNW, as many people do in our country and around the world. Did you also know that wearing white after Labor Day is socially acceptable! I’m grateful to work for a company that respects the labor of hard work and grants us an extra day off on this holiday. Thank you. But shout out to all of the amazing people who are working today and providing for their families, communities, the world and beyond. We salute you! Feeling grateful as I have a couple days off and will be spending it back down in Mexico...but this time in a new city that I’ve never been too! Excited to experience, explore and eat my way through one of my favorite countries, to meet, inspire and be inspired by new people, while learning more about myself along the way. Brb, heading to Guadalajara! 🙏🏾✈️🇲🇽 .

It’s all about being in the right place at the right time. Stopped to take a picture of the gorgeous Rio Cuale and within moments, a fairly large Brown Pelican swooped down gently grazing my head with what I assume was it’s cute little feet and glided into the water. It was quite an interesting experience considering my timing hours before when a Grackle Bird flew into my left shoulder blade on the Malecón which completely startled me. My guess is they were saying hello as they probably recognize me from the sky and have now claimed me as one of them. So I guess I found my tribe. 🐦 ✈️ .

Being jet lagged is just a state of mind, at least that’s what I’m telling myself. We flew in from Thailand at midnight yesterday which was just enough time for me to sleep, do laundry, go to urgent care (I got an infection from a bug bite in Thailand 😖) to be blessed by a doctor to go back out of the country and now here I am. But don’t be too jealous cause it’s not gonna be all beaches and partying...I’m going down with my laptop to actually work, yeh you read that right. I just prefer to do it poolside. BRB, going to Mexico. 🙏🏾🇲🇽✈️ .

To have been able to come back to this beautiful country was such a grateful and blessing opportunity. Meeting the people that I met, seeing the things that I’ve seen and and experiencing the amazing Thai culture all over again. If you’ve yet to travel to Thailand, get on it! And as trashy as the Full Moon Party sounds and frankly kinda is, it’s an experience worth having. 🙏🏾❤️🇹🇭

I had to cancel my months-in-advance reservation at Gaggan, which is the number 4 restaurant in the entire world as we would not have made it in time to fly to Bangkok from Ko Phangan. It was a decision about as hard to make as it was that one time I had to decide if I wanted black leather pants or front row tickets to a Mariah Carey concert. And although I’ll never get to dine at that amazing restaurant as Gaggan himself is closing it next year, I do take comfort in knowing that I have been eating extremely well none the less and that the sheer experience of authentic Thai street food surpasses any word class fine dining experience any day (thinking this way helps heal the wound) as it is all parts unique as it is delicious. Dining at a make shift restaurant that also happens to be the home of the lady who is cooking your food while her daughter happily serves you with a smile is an unparalleled and true experience, and I must say, hundreds of dollars cheaper. Spoiler alert: I never ended up getting those pants, but you already knew that! (not that I can’t pull off leather pants or anything). 🙏🏾❤️🇹🇭

Hi mom, Just checking back in. I’m having an amazing time in Thailand. I’ve traveled to my 5th Island. We arrived yesterday to Ko Phangan. Relaxed by the beach, took a nap and then went to the world famous full moon party. It was one of the greatest and most interesting experiences I’ve ever had. People from all over the entire world coming together to party on the same beach. Don’t worry, I only had 2 beers😬 love and miss you! 🙏🏾❤️🇹🇭

It took forever to get this photo...no seriously, it really did. We left our hotel yesterday in Phuket at 7:30 am to take a 6.5-hour bus ride to head west to the opposite end of the island to the small town of Surat Thani where we took another bus, this time an hour and 15 minutes to Don Sak pier to finally take the 2-hour ferry ride to the island of Ko Samui. Once on the pier we boarded the last 1-hour long bus that drove us to the NW side of the island and dropped us off at our hotel, which is where this photo was just taken. Would I do it again? In a heartbeat...cause you can’t beat the experience of meeting different travelers from around the world and sharing stories with one another and talking about the paths that brought you to cross. It’s the rewarding part of traveling: connecting while making connections. Everything else is just for Instagram.
🙏🏾❤️🇹🇭

Night Markets here in Thailand are a normal way of life and yet are unlike any in the world. In almost every town, there’s a night bazaar each evening where food vendors, retail merchants and artists alike line streets and plazas full of clothes, souvenirs, hand crafted art and of course food. The aromas that fill the air is a unique experience all in its own - endless grilled meats, seafood, and even the rotting scent of perhaps what is considered to be the worlds both loved and hated fruit, the durian, fill the thick warm air and is a distinct reminder of this beautiful and exotic country. They are a way for the entire community and beyond to come together and enjoy cheap and delicious authentic food, music, great art and above all celebrate the unique and exotic culture and diversity. •
We went to Banzaan Market which is off the beaten path and where all the locals go. I’ve always said that sometimes the best food is always found down the alleyways that lead into the neighborhoods where most tourists are afraid to venture through. But if you’re not walking several miles through the nights sweltering heat and humidity down dark and dodgy streets to end up at a bright and bustling locals market to feast on some fresh grilled foods and ice cold beers to people watch while listening to blaringly loud Thai music all for under $10, then you didn’t do Thailand, Thailand did you. 🙏🏾🇹🇭

Spent the afternoon in search of some decent street food and stumbled upon this old man cooking on a make shift food cart/rickshaw connected to his motorcycle. Although this is not traditional Thai, he made probably the best chicken low mein I’ve ever tasted. I paired that with a blueberry smoothie from the guy next to him and then we walked across the street and had lunch with sand between our toes. Not bad for under $7.
🙏🏾🇹🇭🍜🥤

Here we go again! Officially starting off my summer vacation and excited to be traveling with my best friend and partner in crime. This will be our first time traveling this far together and we’re both excited to explore a different country, eat some amazing food and relax by the beach. Here’s to new memories, new friendships, new experiences and plenty of love! BRB, heading to Thailand! 🇹🇭 🙏🏾 ✈️ .

Oh this moment! This is what happens when I do manual labor.
One year ago today I was eating and exploring my way through Thailand. And in just 7 days, I will be back in Thailand eating and exploring yet again, but this time in the south. I’m excited to try all of the amazing food in this new region but still thinking about the delicious dishes from the north. So today I fed my cravings and stopped by @khao_soy_thai for a bowl of khao soy, which is a popular dish that originated from northern Thailand and its neighboring countries of Laos and Myanmar. Crunchy from the rice noodles, sweet from the coconut milk and spicy from the curry, this dish is perfect all year long rain or shine. And although this serves as an amazing prelude to what’s to come, nothing can beat the moment I had this dish at an off the beaten path restaurant that I randomly found 1 year ago in Chiang Mai. 🍜🙏🏾

Give me an inch and I’ll take a lada! Enchilada that is! Throw it back to 6 months ago when I was in Mexico City and got lost trying to find my way out of massive Chapultepec park and instead of finding an exit my fat ass found some bomb enchiladas instead. 🤷🏽‍♂️

When you can’t decide on wether you want the egg sandwich or the pork katsu so you just get them both! 🤷🏽‍♂️ Have you guys been to @giraffegoods yet which is located in @cargoinc on the central east side? It’s a super cute market and deli that sells an array of authentic Japanese products that also include some tasty hot and cold grab-n-go eats and even some amazing sake. Tamago sando which is a very fluffy and creamier egg salad also consisting of a hard boiled egg in the center is a common Japanese snack sold at almost every convenience store in Japan including 7-11 (cause no joke, every other countries 7-11 is way fucking better than the ones we have here in the U.S). This, along with the pork katsu sandwich, is a regular staple amongst school children up to business men grabbing a quick bite before jaunting on to the subway for their morning commute. It’s an easy, filling and cheap snack both in Japan and also here at Giraffe. And you’ve got my word that it’s damn delicious too! Fun fact: I’m just now realizing that we actually stopped at a 7-11 shortly after this photo for a slurpee with no intention of the 2 connecting. 🤯🔮🥪🇯🇵 .

Who knew you could get an almost authentic style burrito in an almost unassuming dive bar. That’s right, the folks over at @kaysbar1934 in the heart of the Sellwood district not only dishes up an insanely huge and insanely delicious wet burrito with tinga chicken smothered in an authentic Oaxacan molé but they’ve also been the go to watering hole for locals and visitors alike since 1934 right after the repeal of prohibition. Follow the bright green awning below the neon pink sign that shouts  KAY’S into it’s dark interior highlighted by the glow of the wood paneled walls and vinyl padding of the half moon booths and bar stools. In there, it’s dingy yet inviting at the same time with a “what’s it gonna be” type greeting from the bartender. Perhaps the classiest thing in here is the leg lamp replica from A Christmas Story. However, it’s an indication to all visitors that Kay’s isn’t your typical pretentious Portland cocktail Insta-lounge, but more of a hole-in-the-wall for the anti Insta-loungers and the anti pretentious. It’s everyone from local regulars to school teachers and blue collar workers to Nike execs all just ending their long day with a local beer and some greasy bar food. It’s a dive bars paradise that just so happens to have one of the best burritos in town. And fun fact: American Poet and Novelist James Dickey wrote a majority of the novel Deliverance in this bar...🌯🍺📖 .

Did you guys hear the news that @anchoipdx was ranked as one of the 10 most “Mind-Blowing Vietnamese Restaurants” in all of Portland? It’s true! Me and my palate can attest to that fact. And listen, in a city that is fast becoming saturated with many-a-Vietnamese and phở concepts, solidifying yourself on a list as such only proves your strength. And the strengths here are delicious Vietnamese food served in a family owned and operated restaurant with warm hospitality and low prices in a casual yet hip environment. Also, the word Anchoi translates as: to eat for fun, and who doesn’t like to eat for fun? 🍖🍲
Get the grilled beef short ribs that are both smoky, sweet and tangy - it’s a kind reminder of my mom’s own recipe. For a bigger appetite, try the vermicelli noodle bowl with your choice of protein (we got the lemongrass chicken) it’s equal parts filling yet light and fresh. 🥥🍹
Need something to wash down that delicious food, they’ve got you covered with an impressive spirits selection as well as hand crafted cocktails designed by Hale Pele’s own Blair Reynolds. But I’m a sucker for fresh coconut water and a very sweet Thai iced tea, so I went non alcohol. Be sure to check out their happy hour which runs daily Monday through Saturday. Thanks for the tasty love Anchoi! .

If you can’t find me this summer check the rooftop patio of @tope_pdx chances are I’ll most likely be up there sunbathing with a cocktail or 2 in hand. Feel free to join but stop by the bar and grab us a pitcher of their famous margaritas before you come outside. 😎☀️🍹🌆

Two of my favorite things: bread and fried chicken. Put them together and you got a bomb ass fried chicken sandwich from our friends over at @jojo.pdx who, as recently as yesterday, was voted the number 2 best food cart in Portland by the foodie experts over at @eaterpdx The cart specializes in fried chicken and you guessed it, jojo’s, which we haven’t had a tastier and sassier combo since Patsy and Edina (AbFab reference) however, I opted solely for the chicken bacon and ranch sandwich. Seriously you guys, this chicken sando is lethal in every positive sense: crunchy, savory, vinegary and messy (like 10 napkins messy). This is one of those places that you know will ultimately gain a huge cult following which will then catapult them to huge fame and success and then eventually  Beyoncé their way to pop super stardom and solidifying their place as a gay icon...well, not so much gay icon as we don’t really fuck with carbs but an ally nonetheless aka they’ll become brick-and-mortar in no time with multiple locations around the city creating a line near you. But until that happens, you lazy asses will have to truck your guts into the Sellwood district for this finger-suckin’ good chicken! Get out there, it’s worth it! 🍗🥪

On the surface, it may appear that I am high maintenance. But in reality, I’m actually not. I enjoy fine things and fine dining but I also love simple things and simple dining. I once had a guy take me on a date to a Costco food court, and not because he was cheap, but because he knew how much I love their pizza, berry smoothies and churros. It was quite romantic because he actually remembered all of that and very sexy cause he had a Costco membership (that’s a deal breaker if you don’t) Ever since then, I’ve always been keen on dining anywhere and in any surrounding so long as the food is good. .
This brings me to local grocer @newseasonsmarket and their delicious made to order wok bowls. I know...it sounds weird to dine in a grocery store, and ok this specific visit, we went specifically to do just that. But once you’ve tried one of the fresh Asian inspired bowls with your choice of protein (I always get chicken) and unlimited fresh veggies topped with one of their many delicious sauces ( I get kung pao) you’ll get what I’m talking about. Portions are huge, flavors are fresh and amazing, and the setting is casual, being able to people watch and judge them buy what’s in their shopping carts 😏. Also as if you needed an extra reason, their Slabtown location by my house has a wine bar with a stellar wine selection that rivals any restaurant, or you can just pick out a bottle you want from the wine aisle and they’ll cork it for you and you can dine al fresco on their sprawling patio which is paw 🐾 friendly and even has heat lamps for those colder summer nights. Date nights will never be the same again. .

I will make you believe you are lovely. 💜
This amazing weather we’ve been having lately has been perfect for picnics, and that’s just what we did. We took Koko to one of her favorite parks in the city, tossed out a big blanket with some cushions in the shade and feasted on some delicious tacos from @mahitacopdx which is one of my favorite taco carts east of the river. It’s a Hawaiian inspired menu  created and prepared by chef/owner and operator Jeff Sandquist who you can find there daily greeting patrons and cooking up tasty island influenced dishes. Rumor is, the Mahi tacos are to die for (hence the namesake) but as I don’t eat much seafood (disgraced Islander) I opted for the chicken taco plate which I actually consider the Mahi of the land: 2 generous portion sized tacos with seasoned chicken, cabbage, lime sauce, pico de gallo and colby cheese paired with mac salad, cole slaw and cilantro lime rice. All complimenting in flavors with spicy, sweet and citrus which was a perfectly balanced meal for an afternoon picnic. The only thing that was able to top that was the view...oh, and the company. So grab some food, find a park and make some delicious memories...or nap. 🐶👬🌮🧺 .

⚠️Warning: delicious graphic content ahead. Viewer discretion advised⚠️ I still cannot get over the fact that I had vegan bbq from @homegrownsmoker the other day and absolutely loved every single bite of it. Look, you have to understand that bbq is part of my cultural heritage of being Islander, I mean we used to bbq practically every day for every occasion growing up but of course with all kinds of meats and seafood - so you can imagine my initial hesitation of eating vegan cue and having little hope or expectations as to avoid being let down in the end. But boy was I wrong. THIS SHIT IS BOMB!!!
.
We came specifically on a Wednesday cause that’s the day when they feature their rotating crunch wrap, a dish that they’ve become quite known for when they were operating as a food cart. This was the be all end all for me. Crunchy, “meaty”, “cheesy”, huge and delicious. You would never guess that this was not made with actual meat or cheese. We also ordered a bbq combo plate with smoked “short ribs” and smoked “chikn” smothered in their macnocheese and their sweet and tangy bbq beans. It was a gut bomb in a good way and worth breaking my diet for. I got the same satisfied stuffed feeing that I always get after eating my mom’s bbq, and then that same craving for more that I get an hour later. To all my fellow carnivores out there: swallow your pride and then come feast on some finger licking good animal-less barbecue. 🌱🙏🏾

🚨 Shameless Selfie Alert🚨 
On second thought...I’ve got no shame in my game. I’m proud of the growth I’m showing: physically mentally, emotionally. It takes a lot of discipline and commitment to be able to push yourself/body to produce a specific result and although physically I’m still not where I wish to be, it always feels good to be at the start line rather than on the sidelines. I’ve been pushing to get into some sort of decent shape for the summer as the past several months I was just shoving anything and everything into my mouth (literally) while going out every night and I knew I had to pull back and focus on my health. And when you’re able to take a step back and make those types of decisions for yourself it’s a great sign of personal growth. So glow up! Have pride! Post those selfies of all kinds of transformations that you allow yourself to go through. There’s no shame in celebrating your personal achievements. 🙏🏾❤️

While I’m currently off of carbs at the moment (forgive me for my weird behavior as a result) I’m still thinking about the delicious lemongrass chicken banh mi sandwich and spring rolls I had @cuonpdx several days ago. I rewarded myself after finishing a 4-mile run cause I needed and excuse to to feel better about eating all this deliciousness. Cuôn (pronounced coon) translates to roll in Vietnamese. It’s a common street food in Vietnam, made as a fueling snack with fresh vegetables and proteins most commonly with simple shrimp or pork, but this authentic family owned and operated restaurant goes a little further and offers a variety of different types of proteins including: tofu, tempura shrimp and soft shell crab. I went for the pork sausage and lemon grass chicken which are 2 of my favorite Vietnamese style meats. An amazing tasty and filling lunch after a hard run. I’m hoping that I might be able to squeeze in a short stop to Vietnam next month when I’m back in Asia, as I’m sure the street food there is exactly like this, but times 10! 🙏🏾🥖🇻🇳 .

Need a healthy suggestion on how to stay cooled down during this mini heat wave we have approaching? Our friends over at @littlebeanpdx in the Pearl have got us all covered with some delicious chickpea ice cream. You read that right, it’s chickpeas for ice cream which means that this is all non-dairy, gluten-free, soy-free, nut-free, non-GMO, sustainable and environmentally friendly, even down to their house made waffle cones,  cookies and other baked treats. And to answer your question, yes, it takes just like regular ice cream only with more unique flavors and again, way more healthier. It’s no wonder they had the nerve to open right next door to my gym.🍦💪🏾

It’s official, in 1 Month from today I will be traveling back to Asia and this time basing myself out of the south islands of Thailand. This will mark 1 year this July since the first time I ever stepped foot into this beautiful country where I wandered through the north to explore the rich culture while finding myself through travel. And now I am excited to see a different region, learn more about the culture and history, tour the gorgeous islands and of course, eat delicious food. Hopefully I can learn more about myself again along the way. Let the countdown begin. 🇹🇭🙏🏾

It’s only been 1 week since my most recent trip to Mexico and I can’t stop thinking about @elpechugon which is a classic Mexican rosticería window located in Vallarta’s Zona Romantica neighborhood and was right outside my hotel. I’ve been here before, years ago and now every time I come to PV, I always stop by for the best chicken I’ve ever had in my life. It’s a unique set up as it’s carved out of the side of a building with a huge rotisserie that rotates deliciously crispy and well seasoned chickens that are equal parts juicy and tender. The meals come complete with fresh tortillas, salsa, jalapeños, and gold potatoes that rest underneath the rotisserie catching and soaking up all of the amazing dripping and juices from the chicken. Prices are very cheap and you can get an entire chicken with all the included sides plus rice for around $8 USD. It’s good wholesome food for the working class people. Lines form outside of this place all hours of the day and for good reason. But the wait is worth it. My suggestion: order the half bird with an extra side of potatoes, grab a cold 6 pack of Tecate, and head to the hidden beach Conchas Chinas for a relaxing lunch, swim and a nap. 🍗🍺🏝

I am currently in the works of planning my next big vacation for next month, and it seems as if all signs are pointing back to Asia. It’s something about the rich heritage and cultural history paired with exotic foods and amazing scenery which is so unparalleled that is drawing me back. Where I ultimately end up however is still in up in the air, but in the meantime, here’s a photo of when I was in Thailand last year and randomly stumbled into Soi Cowboy— one out of 3 of Bangkok’s famed red light districts. It was an experience to say the least, wandering up and down the long stretch of alley way observing the energy and lights that gleamed into the hopeful eyes of the drunk and horny tourists. In America, we call it last call at any bar. In Thailand, it’s just another Tuesday night. 🇹🇭 .

A huge thank you to the gracious and amazing team at @garlandsdelrio for a relaxing getaway. This is my favorite boutique hotel located right in the beating heart of Puerto Vallarta’s famed Zona Romantica resting along the Rio Cuale and surrounded by restaurants, nightlife, shopping and of course steps from the beaches of Banderas Bay. .
.
This independently owned and operated bed and breakfast features 17 suites each with a unique theme that are all well decorated with rare antiques along with gorgeous hand painted murals and paintings created by their in-house artist that are all visibly scattered through out the entire space and in each room and common area. The property wraps around a beautiful courtyard designed to be a tropical oasis in the middle of the city that makes it feel as if a mirage took place there. It’s the focal point of the property and what gathers visitors from all around the world to either lounge by the sapphire blue pool or imbibe at the honor bar, where guests help themselves to cocktails, beers and other refreshments, noting down their name and room number and what they enjoyed to be charged at the end of their stay. It’s a true testimony to the trust and community that Garlands and their team encourage to exist which makes the stay here even more enjoyable. Breakfast is served every morning either in the courtyard, on the back terrace by the river, or on your private balcony. Whether it’s a relaxing getaway your seeking or a romantic retreat with your partner, Garlands Del Rio is the place to feel like a queen...or a king. 🏨🙏🏾❤️

I met the most amazing people last night who I now get to call friends. I also had a conversation with a local about what it’s like to currently be living in the U.S and they opened up about once living in the states but got deported because of this fucked up political government we are under. We cried and then we all danced the night away and then filled our faces with delicious street food. I slept in and had breakfast brought to my room and sat peacefully on my patio listening to the tropical bird song while I ate. I treated myself to a pedicure and a massage and now I’m sitting by the beach feeling blessed and grateful for the opportunity and privilege that I have, as I was reminded last night that most people don’t. Stay humble. 🙏🏾✌🏾

I’m doing another last minute trip out of town cause I feel that mentally, spiritually, emotionally and even physically I can use it. It’s been a long couple weeks and I’m just needing some me time by the beach - music in my ears, a cold margarita and a good nap. But let’s make sure that we take this moment to honor and remember the many, many, many of women and men who continue to sacrifice their life for this country so that everyone: gay, straight, trans, black, Muslim, and women who just want their basic fundamental rights can have the freedom to do so! America, figure your shit out while I continue to do the same. Happy Memorial Day. Brb, heading back to Mexico. 🙏🏾❤️

Do you guys remember being a kid and hearing that jingle play off in the distance. And as it got clearer and louder you had like .5 seconds to ask your mom for $1 so that you can scurry your little chicken legs out to the sidewalk and stand there like you was hoe-ing yourself out waving that truck down with that $1 in your hand - all to get that popsicle that was in the shape of a baseball mitt, you know the pink one with the gum ball stuck in the middle that was hard as fuck cause it was cold- and the flavor only lasted for 3 minutes when you really wanted a choco taco but it was $1.50 and your hoe ass only had $1. Was that just me? 🍦
Anyhow, @fiftylicks has an actual ice cream truck that does not play music nor does it drive up and down the street making kids look like crackheads running out their houses with cash and change in hand trying to get their fix. Instead, it’s stationed on NW 24th in front of @betsyandiya and although they may not have choco tacos, they do serve their famous made to order waffle cones paired with their delicious and unique flavors of ice cream!🍦 .

When I was a little kid, I would always ask my mom for $5...specifically $5 because back then I thought that was a lot of money and I imagined all the candy that it could buy me...and I think secretly I also had a thing for Abraham Lincoln 😏. As an adult now, I stopped eating candy and $5 is just not as much as I used to think it was. However, my favorite pizza joint @lifeofpiepizza has one of the longest happy hours in the world from 11 am to 6 pm daily and features one of the best damn Margherita pizzas I’ve ever had in my life for only $5!!! If I could go back in time and speak with little me, I would tell him: beards are just a phase and you’ll be over it soon (sorry Abe 😒) and to save all them $5 bills cause one day, you’ll be out of your candy phase and into pizza 🍕! .

Did you know that May is Asian Pacific Islander Heritage Month, or aptly known as API Month? Yeh, I didn’t know that either. I guess it’s because I celebrate my heritage all year long as I or or anyone of cultural ethnicity should for that matter. I get it, even on the islands my own people consider me as; “mainland” or “haole” or “white washed.” And here on the mainland I’m considered too ethnic or brown or an immigrant (although I was born in Hawaii). It’s true, I don’t follow the traditions of my island people as much as I should, and I don’t speak fluently my cultural language as well yet I can still understand it...But I am Micronesian, strong and proud Palauan. Being able to visit @lansuchinesegarden for the first time yesterday after living in Portland for almost 9 years was inspiring. This garden located in Portland’s failed China Town District is an exact replica of what an actual Chinese garden looks like. It was all parts peaceful, calming, inspiring and thought provoking and I learned more about the Chinese culture (my grouped culture) then I knew before. I’ve always associated myself with the Asian culture since I was able to check off the boxes on legal documents that required me to identify as Asian/Pacific Islander or Other. Because I knew, even though I was lazily grouped into a category of other amazing cultures and identity as Pacific Islander, I always felt like the “other”. Happy API Month, I guess. .

Never will I take her natural beauty for granted. Never will I let my problems rise higher than her tallest mountains far above the clouds or deep beneath her darkest oceans. Never will I speak disrespect against her direction or beauty, for she is who creates direction and beauty. Respect her in awe. Respect her in song and poem. Allow her to be the strength and the beating heart that binds all living beings together. Fierce and unapologetic, she is Mother Nature. 🙏🏾❤️

There’s always something so dark and hauntingly beautiful about capturing images in black and white. Is it because even from infancy we are taught to see this world in color? Is it because when we imagine our lives devoid of all color, our minds immediately begin to vision a world filled with sadness and a lacking of joy and promise. But there is beauty in sadness that’s what makes it beautiful. 🖤

Last night’s sunset was sheer breathtaking. We took a nap from running around the beach all day and woke up just in time to grab blankets, snacks and hot tea and stepped outside and got cozy on top of a sandy bluff to await one of nature’s most beautiful shows. You can’t help but to become emotional when you see something so captivating and honest. This was the part that brought me to tears. Its a perfect reminder to appreciate everything you have and to never take anything, even sunsets for granted.

Sometimes you just need to escape the city and head to the coast to put your life on pause and reflect. Rented a condo right on the ocean and spent our time relaxing by the beach disconnecting from life’s everyday demands. It was mentally, spiritually and emotionally freeing. 🙏🏾🌊🐶

Had such an amazing time yesterday imbibing at @straightawaycocktails which is a locally owned distillery that creates and bottles delicious cocktails ready to pour-just chill or serve on ice-perfect for entertaining guests. These adorable and tasty flights were accompanied with snack pairings delivered by a friendly and knowledgeable server in a colorful, hip and airy environment. The only thing that made it better was the company. Thanks Caroline and Casey for the invite! And to Nicole and Eric for a great night out of fun conversation and laughs! 🙏🏾❤️

Sometimes, you just crave dicks in your mouth. Fun fact: in my early 20’s I was broke and living in Capitol Hill and spending all of my money on rent and socializing...that left me with not much to eat but enough to spend a small amount of money to eat a bag of dicks...ahem, I mean @dicksdrivein for quite sometime. Cause their burgers and fries are legit. And the experience of standing in that long ass line with a bunch of other drunk people is hella real-meeting so many diverse and other dick lovers and creating a moment. So my advice to you young generation Z’ers is: eat dicks! Put dicks in your mouth, and crave dicks! Get your posse on Broadway! .

Last night was amazing! I saw one of my favorite bands from London @tenderofficialmusic perform and as fate would have it, I was taking a picture of their sign before the show when all of a sudden the lead singer @jamesstephencullen casually walks by and so I fan girled him into taking a picture with me (he offered and was so kind) and then they got on stage and gave me life through their music. This is a band who’s many songs are in my run playlist and everyone knows running is an emotional and mental escape for me, so to be in front of these guys perform those songs was simply moving. An amazing show for sure! 🙏🏾❤️

Need a suggestion on a great date night spot in downtown Portland? My new favorite hideaway @abigailhallpdx is the best place to get drinks before or after any occasion. I love the dim lit ambiance paired with the hip warm glow of the soft colorful tones and Art Deco style aesthetics. It’s sexy but in a refined kind of way. Get here, drink here! 🍹🥃

Today I was blessed to be able to wake up and help support and motivate good people in my life as they motivated me. We all woke up this morning with the intention of challenging  ourselves and accomplishing our personal goals, and we did. Mile 7-9 really tested every part of me physically, mentally, and emotionally. I turned up the music in my ears and I pushed through and it was a huge moment and a feeling that’s hard to describe a version of myself that I didn’t know I had. Thinking about my life and how I’ve changed as a person at only 35 is what put me on the course in the first place. But what got me to the finish line was thinking about the lives that no longer have the opportunity to ever feel this high or set personal goals. Today, we ran for all of the lives that can’t. #supportlove 🖤🖤🖤🏃🙏🏾

That one time in Bangkok when it was super hot and humid out so I took refuge in @terminal21asok mall and wandered around and shopped up an appetite to one of the top floor restaurants and ordered 3 refreshing desserts to myself to cool off and unwind. Fun fact: Bangkok is filled with massive shopping malls in the form of sky scrapers that tower the city most with different themes. This unique one was modeled after an airport with each sprawling level themed after different countries. These malls are created for the sole purpose of not ever having to leave with air conditioning being one of the major attractions. The others of course are: multiple levels of retail, hundreds of restaurants which include entire food courts dedicated to authentic street food, and many forms of entertainment from movie theaters to bowling alleys, spas and salons. These certainly put the malls here in the U.S to shame and you can literally plan a separate trip to BKK just to explore all of their many shopping mecca’s. .

To my mother Julia...a bad ass woman; fearless and courageous. Strong yet gentle. Kind and hospitable. Glorious. Everything I know, I learned from her. Heart, passion, empathy. A willingness to live, love and inspire those around her. Happy International Women’s Day Mom. Thank you for all you’ve ever done for me. And to all the other amazing powerful women in my life who continue to help shape my heart, soul and mind and have allowed me to become the confident man I am today, I respect you always. 🙏🏾❤️🙌🏾

Every time I travel to San Francisco I always make a strict point to visit China Town. It’s just so authentic and cultural and to me feels like being in Asia. Although Grant Street tends to cater more to tourists and Stockton is more for locals, we did stumble upon a great restaurant on Grant with delicious dim sum. Our goal was too find a true authentic Chinese restaurant and we certainly accomplished it at Far East Cafe. The service was swift, the food delicious, and the ambiance was genuine. Dim sum is one of my favorite dining experiences especially with friends and big groups. Definitely make a point to stop by Far East on your next trip to San Francisco’s China Town. And after you’ve eaten your weight in steamed pork buns, head 2 blocks down to Li Po cocktail lounge and order “the original Chinese mai tai” from Connie. 🙏🏾❤️🥟🍘🍚🍹

After an awesome show seeing @morgxnofficial perform live and several drinks later, we of course sparked up some late night hunger pains and needed some heavy comfort food to soak up all the booze. I had heard many good things about @tommysjoyntsf and knew that being drunk at 1 am was the perfect opportunity for us to go. It’s a no frills, in your face, you get what you get and like you’ll like it style Hofbrau. Meats marinated and slowly cooked daily with lines of people forming outside to get some cheap eats and cheap drinks and eat with their elbows on the table in this casual blue collar atmosphere. •
We ordered a little bit of everything: beef brisket with gravy, mashed potatoes and side salad, tri-tip sandwich with mustard, a ham hoagie and a slice of carrot cake and chocolate cake, cause b-day. The beef brisket and tri-tip was melt in your mouth ahh-mazing, and you know I’m very picky about the type of meat I put in my mouth 😜. What’s great is that this place specifically keeps their prices low to help cater to the hungry work force who at the end of the day just want a hearty, comforting, filling meal and a cheap beer. 🙏🏾❤️🥪🍖

Had an amazing birthday dinner last night @lecolonialsf outside of Union Square. This beautiful space actually used to be home to legendary Trader Vic’s which you can still see some reminiscence of, specifically upstairs in their bar. The cuisine is Vietnamese blended with some French influence, quite like its ambiance. The food was delicious and the company was amazing. Shortly after dinner Chris surprised me with tickets to see @morgxnofficial one of my favorite artists who was performing at small venue not too far away. Dinner and a show in beautiful San Francisco. 35 is starting off deliciously well for me. Thank you Chris. 🙏🏾❤️

Currently at my birthday dinner but still thinking about my birthday lunch we had today which was from the world famous @tonyspizza415 located in San Francisco’s Little Italy. Seriously you guys, this was hands down the best pizza I have ever had in my life. And now I know why pizza chef Tony Gemignani is a 13-time World Pizza Champion. Seriously you guys, I broke my diet specially to eat here and I have no regrets. •
We ordered the ‘New Yorker’ which received a gold medal and has mozzarella, hand crushed tomato sauce, natural casing pepperoni, sliced Italian fennel sausage, calabrese sausage, ricotta, chopped garlic and oregano 👊🏾 life changing. So now, until I can convince them to deliver up to Portland, I will now be flying down to San Francisco anytime I get a pizza craving. 🍕🙏🏾❤️

It’s my 35th birthday today and Chris is surprising me with a mini trip for shopping and dinner in one of my favorite cities. He planned this for several weeks and didn’t reveal the destination until we got to the airport this morning. I don’t feel or look 35 (thanks for the genes mom and dad) but so happy to be alive and living this amazing blessed life that I get to call mine. Not asking for any donations  to any charities or organizations. But what I am asking from all of you is that you do something selfless today: support a local business owner; support a person of color; support an LGBTQ person; support a person who is displaced; spread love and cheer. Close your eyes and open your heart and let’s all celebrate this amazing and crazy life together. BRB, heading to San Francisco. ❤️🙏🏾 ✈️ .

Need a good suggestion on where to get some warm comfort food on this cold and rainy Tuesday? Look no further than @theboilingbowl tucked away on NW 21st. Obviously, this place is all about their Phó hence the name of the restaurant and I hear it’s delicious. But it’s always hard for me to turn down a good vermicelli bowl, and their grilled pork bowl is out of this world. The smokey and sweet flavors of the tender charred pork won it for me. The bonus is that this place is authentic Vietnamese food ran by an authentic Vietnamese family, and you know I love to support. 🍲❤️🙏🏾

How insane in this!? Sorry, I had to record it from @skygypsyro phone to show you this beautiful and amazing conversation I just had with @janine who is one of the best female vocalists and songwriters on the music scene right now. Her heart is so big and her music is fucking amazing and I cannot believe that she video chatted with me! Please, please, please, follow her and listen to her music. You guys have already heard some of my favorite songs from her in my stories: “unstable”, “we could be better”, “lose my mind” and “hold me”. She’s gonna blow up and I’m so thankful that I had this opportunity to express to her how her music has made me feel and how it infects and heals me, when I need it! Love you Janine! ❤️🙏🏾

Omg!!! Omg!! Omg!!!! My favorite artist @janine who you’ve heard me play a lot of her music in my stories just did a live chat with me on Instagram and now I can die!!! She is so fucking sweet and her music has gotten me through a lot! Go check her Instagram page and look at the live video she just posted and you can see me having such a genuine and heartfelt conversation with her. I’m literally dying and at a loss for words that she chose to speak with me out of all her fans and followers! I love you so much Janine! You made my year! Thank you for listening to me and letting your music get me through every run and heartbreak! 🙏🏾❤️😱

I’m craving this burrito from my favorite family owned and operated street food cart in Puerto Vallarta’s Old Town neighborhood. This is literally the best burrito I’ve ever had in my life. I discovered this place several trips ago and now every time I go to PV, I make a point to stop here. The family is just so friendly and kind and you can taste their warmth and passion in their food. Sitting on a plastic lawn chair at 3 am partially sober rubbing elbows with the locals and chasing down a Mexican Coke is my idea of a vacation. #takemeback 🙏🏾🇲🇽🌯 .

Not quite the snow-pocalypse that Portland was predicting. Too much hype built around it and a ton of people lined up at the grocery stores acting a a damn mess. I’m literally just hoping that I can fly back to Mexico in the event that my work closes and I get a 4-day weekend. Fingers crossed! 🤞🏾

🚨Shameless selfie alert🚨 
Still trying to figure out how to hold on to this tan I got from Mexico. That’s right, I tan! Also, I’m approaching 35 in a couple weeks and thanking my parents for the amazing genes...and my barber for the fade...cause I don’t feel or look 35. But it all starts with being unapologetically confident and not caring what the fuck people think about you. Also, a good attitude and importantly a kind heart...and then the people that you surround yourself with. Oh, And it helps that I’m islander too. Cause if black don’t crack, then brown don’t frown. 🙏🏾 #kalanididit .

Now do you see why I fly down to Puerto Vallarta just to get my haircut? This barber is everything! Only $250 MXN Peso which is $13 for a cut and the full classic beard trim with hot towel service, hot shave and classic straight razor. Plus, he’s damn fine! 😍❤️🇲🇽🙏🏾

Because it’s my birthday month and I plan on celebrating every day I can...Because I don’t give 2 fucks about the Super Bowl and I really don’t want to be in this country right now...Because I’m off for the next couple days and I need to be lounging by the beach versus the frigid ass cold of Portland...And lastly, because I need my hair cut and my favorite barber who I fell in love with is down in Mexico. Brb, heading back to Puerto Vallarta! 🙏🏾🇲🇽 ❤️

If you ask me where my favorite late night date spot is, I’ll tell you that it’s @victoria_pdx . I only go at night, but let’s not forget that they have a huge patio and the day moments are amazing. But I love the nights there cause it’s so dark and intimate. And guess what, the food is fucking good and cheap. Something for everyone, with vegan options and carnivore as well. I love the aesthetics...hip, relevant and sexy. Check them out. 🙏🏾

I’ve always been an advocate for supporting the arts specifically the local arts/artists. After an amazing and emotional tour of the Museum of Modern Art in Mexico City, I wandered aimlessly through the sprawling acreage of Chapultepec Park and just soaked in the diversity, beauty and vibrancy of the culture and surroundings to immerse myself into the elements. It was then, at that time when I was searching for an exit out of this massive green landscape that I stumbled upon Enrique, a local artist who was sitting modestly, off to the side of the park hand-crafting his own paintings. He had a small display of about 10 mini images which were all all framed and constructed by his own artistic hands while steadfastly designing work on new pieces. There was a language barrier that prevented an explanation of why the imagery was what it was, but nonetheless, I was still connected and internally I understood. I watched him create amazing and alluring scenery from brush to canvas in real time with no hesitation and I was able to witness the beauty in his mind. At no point did he look up at me to provide some sort of sales pitch as he just kept flowing with creativity. I purchased 4 of his pieces, and now I constantly think about his beautiful creative mind and heart. If you decide to buy souvenirs, skip all the mass produced fake shit like keychains, sombreros and designer knock-off items...find the person who is pouring their heart into something that will really connect you back to your experience, and then support them. 🙏🏾❤️🇲🇽

Honestly, I don’t even know what this is called. But I do remember walking through beautiful Chapultepec Park and seeing multiple people eating it. And by the time I saw the 5th person grinding on it, I told myself I needed to get one. So I stopped by a street food vendor that was selling some and asked what it was and there was a little bit of disconnect due to my not knowing much Spanish - but once I confirmed there was no seafood, I ordered it. It’s lettuce, tomatoes, grilled onions, avocado, sour cream, spicy salsa on a big ass cracker...I mean, I was just impressed cause the only cracker I’ve ever seen this big is Roseanne Barr. But it was good. Messy, but good. A nice snack to keep me occupied while I wandered the massive park. 🙏🏾🇲🇽

There are only 2 street vendors in this world where I will order a hot dog from. 1) is the cart outside the alley of where gay-conic Neighbours Nightclub is located in Seattle’s Capitol Hill District cause that Seattle dog saved me many a drunk nights in my 20’s and number 2). is the hot dog cart outside of the Oxxo in Puerto Vallart’s Old Town neighborhood. Let me tell you when I say, after a night of going out and livin’ that best life dancing and imbibing with friends, this spot that is open on random nights starting at 10 pm is a shiny magical beacon of hope. Hope that the toasted buns and crispy bacon piled on by grilled jalapeños, onions and all the sauces will soak up all that tequila so that you can recover gracefully the next day to lay by the beach in shame and think about those random strangers that snap chatted you twerking on a bar. 🕺🏾🌭🤤

Last night after seeing some amazing friends and a couple of glasses of sparkling wine, I started thinking about the amazing burrito that I would always get back in Puerto Vallarta late at night at my favorite street food cart deep in the hood. First of all, we don’t have any food carts in the NW District of Portland so if someone wants to open a pod or just 1, please do...and secondly, Portland food carts will never be as good as authentic street food in Mexico. 🙏🏾🌯🇲🇽

Sometime’s I dine at super boujee restaurants but most of the time I prefer street food. It’s the most true authentic dining experience in any ethnic country and a great way to connect with the locals and develop a better understanding of who they are through their food and Mexico has some amazing street food. It’s not for everyone as it takes an iron stomach or at least a risk and a prayer but it’s worth it all around, for flavor and value and just the sheer experience. .
This is called Arrieros, and it was the fjrst time I’ve ever had it and I’m hoping not the last. I was recommended it through my favorite street food vendor that I get all my burritos and tacos at. It really is mixture of everything and your choice of protein on a grilled tortilla, almost like a Mexican pizza. I need it back in my life cause it’s all I’m thinking about so if anyone knows where I can get this here in Portland, speak up! 🙏🏾

I’m reflecting on this trip and how much I’ve learned...about Mexico, it’s culture, their history and myself. Ever since I was a little kid I always needed to move and be somewhere and see people and places. And now as an adult, I’m fortunate to be able to travel and roam this earth to understand more...I recommend everyone travel to a different country and do it alone. When you travel by yourself you strip away the comfort and protection that we naturally put up to block others out of who we are and it forces you to connect and relate and rely on others you normally would never have met. Traveling is a journey that you create yourself. And it can be anywhere in this world you want it to be as long as you’re not just taking something but making a point to also leave something behind: Your kindness, your heart, your spirit.

I crossed another one off the bucket list and went to the pyramids at Teotihuacán and I felt every possible emotion in my body. The sheer beauty of this massive archaeological site with its sordid history was just so fascinating. I climbed both the Pyramid of the Sun and the Pyramid of the Moon, threw in some good music in my ears and just took it all in. There are no words. Just chills and now memories. Slowly and slowly as I see this world, I begin to see more about myself.

Hi Mom! Just checking in and letting  you know that I’m still alive. I’m living by the many rules of life that you taught me. I’ve been on a personal journey lately and have been reflecting on myself as a human in this world and I’m finding more wisdom and growth and learning how to apply that to this amazing life of mine while helping to inspire and love others. Cheers from the beautiful coast of Puerto Vallarta! ❤️🙏🏾

Dear Mexico City, thank you for everything from the bottom of my heart. Thank you for sharing your history, culture, art, music, food and hospitality with me. Thank you for the amazing friendships that you’ve introduced me too and proving what I’ve always known: that you just need to close your eyes and open your heart. You’ve taught me so much about you in these past couple of days while also teaching me more about myself and I cannot wait to return to learn more. .
But I’m not done with you yet México. It’s time for some sun, sand, a relaxing nap by the beach and of course more food in one of my favorite cities...Puerto Vallarta, here I come! ✈️🇲🇽🙏🏾

I’ve just reached gold status in the foodie world, at least that’s what I’m telling myself. Tonight’s dinner @pujolrestaurant was simply amazing. From the modern contemporary interior and ambiance to the world class tailored service and of course the amazing food by renowned chef Enrique Olvera. This restaurant is forever booked out months in advance, and in fact, when I booked my trip to CDMX in November, reservations were already sold out through mid February. So you can imagine my shock when I heard that there was an opening tonight, I jumped at the chance and landed a reservation. I ordered from their 9-course Omakse Taco menu which was up to what the chef was feeling that evening and is hosted at an intimate long bar seating for 12. The majority of dishes were seafood but with advanced notice, I was able to have them modify those items for me. Each course has an alcohol pairing but I opted for non-alcohol with every mocktail designed with thought by hand to pair with the flavors of the food. This is molecular gastronomy with a distinct emphasis on Mexican cuisine right here from the country in which Chef Olvera hails from. Every course was evenly spaced out, giving us gleeful patrons a moment to reflect in awe of the last. Every dish arrived neatly and presented to each of us at the same time with a detailed description of every ingredient by the staff. It was heaven. After the 8th course, we were all then treated to a tour of their herb and vegetables garden where fresh ingredients are hand picked and incorporated each evening. From their, we were led to an intimate terrace with heat lamps and roaring fire, a separate bar and assigned seating for the final dessert course paired with a traditional Mexican coffee. This was dining at the ultimate extreme. A true telling of why they have been recognized as one of the “50 Best Restaurants in the World” as well as number 5 in all of Latin America. It’s a life experience, not a meal. If you ever find yourself heading to Mexico City, book your reservation here in advance and allow yourself to be taken on a word class culinary journey. 🙏🏾🇲🇽

These are perhaps the best beef and pork street tacos that I have ever had so far out of all the different cities I’ve been too in Mexico. I spotted this row of street food vendors on my walking tour with Guillermo. They are tiny little cut outs on the side of a historic building with different operators selling various types of delicious foods. I wish you guys could smell the beautiful aromas that were filling the air - it was a nice change from the thick smog. I didn’t want to ask Guillermo to stop the tour for food so I made a point to remember where it was to come back after and eat. It’s funny cause I can’t remember how to get to my hotel from certain areas but you know fat me channeled that 6th sense that we foodies have and I burned into my mind the exact gps coordinates and skipped my hungry ass right there. And this is why I was late to the Frida Kahlo museum! 🙏🏾🇲🇽🤤

What an amazing day exploring Mexico City’s Historical Central District also known as Centro Histórico. I did a free walking tour with @kactustour.mx and spent 2 hours with my guide Guillermo who was amazing and knowledgeable about the history of this city. I was the only one on the tour so it felt personable and tailored. We saw it all and He covered everything! Did you know that Centro Histórico is built on top of Aztec temples and pyramids? The biggest Aztec pyramid named Templor Mayo which is a UNESCO world site sits in the middle of the Centro and was only discovered in the 70’s when electricians were digging underground and struck the pyramid. The city has now unearthed it for people to witness in awe and in fact, as they continue to repave roads, or do construction for their underground subway or even work on their sewer systems they are finding more and more Aztec temples some of which are now exposed underneath your feet on random streets in thick glass panels. Did you also know that this city was built on a massive lake and every year, the city sinks more and more? As you go through the city you start to see historic buildings that have succumb to their fate and are being sucked into the ground. 
The architecture in found here is also quite fascinating and beautiful. Cathedrals, monuments, presidential palaces and galore that were once created by the Spanish still echoes its sordid history. You can feel the presence of so much culture and history dating 1000’s of years back. 
If you come to Mexico City look up Kactus tours and ask for Guillermo. This young man is studying to be an architect and his knowledge and passion for his own cultural heritage is just inspiring. Cheers to his bright and amazing future! 🙏🏾🇲🇽

Well I struck out with the Frida Kahlo museum today as I got there late and they had already shut off the long ass line waiting outside...but I was able to make it to the Museum of Modern Art yesterday and wow...I spent nearly 2 1/2 hours there admiring these one of a kind pieces created by prolific Mexican artists with many dating back to the early 1900’s. It was an emotional journey for me as this type of art really hits a deeper spot in my heart. There were countless pieces in this incredible space and I took pictures of so many - but these few really stood out too me. This city is filled with plenty of amazing museums and if you come here, make a point to go to see the Modern Art...and of course, Frida - just get there early! 🙏🏾🇲🇽

I hung out with the coolest fucking girls last night who are visiting from Brooklyn and now we are connected and will be visiting each other this year back in the states. I also hung out with a fellow Portlander who just happened to be at my hotel - we had an amazing conversation about equality. And lastly I learned that eating ball park nachos at the local 7-11 drunk at 1 am is trashy but no one here judges. Off to make more experiences! 🙏🏾❤️🇲🇽

I’m gonna go ahead and say that 2018 was a good year for me. I’ve learned a lot and experienced a lot....I’ve seen more about this world than most people could ever dream - but there is still more exploring for me to do...for all of us to do...My goal is to ultimately learn and understand more about different cultures and different views while trying to figure out who I am as the amazing person I am now becoming. This was never just about traveling and dining. It was about trying to find my small place in this world and from there explore and see what I could do to help inspire all of you: as a partner, a friend, a son, a brother, an uncle, a manager as a person of color! The time has come where I get to explore that side of me yet again and this time in a different city and what better way to do that than on New Year’s Eve!? I’ll be in the air at midnight tonight for the new year, but thank you to everyone who made 2018 possible for me. For the love, the drama, and the heartache. It’s time for me to go rediscover myself yet again. BRB, heading to Mexico City. 🙏🏾✌🏾✈️ 🇲🇽 .

Just a reminder that @eaterpdx voted @bhunarestaurant chef Deepak Kaul the best “Chef of 2018” in Portland. It’s true, I dined there and it was delicious. This isn’t just some trendy concept, It’s Kashmirian soul food from India, stories of his heritage told through authentic flavors. It’s a break between the  trashy dive bars that line 21st Avenue and just what this neighborhood needed. ✨
I was quite taken back by the immense flavors of the Goan Pork Vindaloo which was spicy from the Thai chilies but also softened by the sweetness of the jaggery. Try the Kashmiri mushrooms with fried egg, daikon chutney and naan - I would describe it as a Kashmirian pizza, perfect on its own. Here, the food matters because it’s coming from his heart. I’ve always stood firm that if you want to eat ethnic food, go as authentic as you can and you shouldn’t look no further then to find it at Bhuna. 🙏🏾

To my sis @lindsey.maya let’s go down in history! #goals
I think it’s socially unacceptable for Vancouver BC to have any restaurants that have not cleared an aesthetics test. I’m certain that there is an aesthetics committee that must deem your space design worthy in order for you to operate. Every restaurant in this city is just so damn pretty. 
I slept-in and as a result I missed my opportunity to dine at my favorite Vancouver eatery @hawksworthrest owned by revered chef and restauranteur David Hawksworth. Luckily for me their sister restaurant @nightingalerest was steps away from my hotel and open late. The food here is Canadian modern with seasonal and international flavors, sourced by fresh PNW ingredients in a beautiful dimly lit and contemporary interior housed in a historic building. 
The food was delicious. I ordered the charred lamb chops with red harissa, mint charmoula and wild rice dukkah which paired beautifully with the fennel salsa verde that complimented the roasted cauliflower. It’s clear that Chef David has really had a hand with influencing the endless food scene here in BC, giving Vancouverites and beyond a craving for what some would consider haute-cuisine but is done in an approachable less pretentious way. He’s just simply brilliant and I cannot wait to come back. 🙏🏾✨🐦

I have several favorite restaurants in Vancouver BC but the winner for decor goes too @botanistdining located on the mezzanine level of the beautiful @fairmontpacific off the seawall. Don’t get me wrong, the food here is delicious as well. The beef tartare with smoked egg yolk rivals that of my all time favorite down in San Diego, and the vegetable cavatelli was perfect in flavor and texture. But the aesthetics of the interior is truly beautiful. 
Its Art Deco with mid-century modern. Minimalistic and simple yet intricate with warm pinks, blues and greens. It was impossible not too feel happy in this space. A palatable feast for both the eyes and mouth. Their cocktail program is quite simply the most innovative I’ve ever seen with a dedicated ‘cocktail lab’ where their bar scientists seamlessly concoct one of a kind creations. It was lunch time and I had just flown in moments before and with hours of shopping ahead of me and on no sleep, I passed on the opportunity to imbibe how we that moment will come soon as I look forward to heading back. If you’re ever in beautiful British Columbia, add this too your list. Indulge your many senses in the spectacular show that the team of professionals display here. 🙏🏾✨

Because the year is coming to a close and I wanna be able to say that in 2018 I went to 4 different countries, had 12 different trips, explored and ate my way through multiple cities, met and got inspired by new people while learning a lot about myself along the way. And because I’m so grateful for the opportunities that I have and will never take them for granted. Because I love big cities with diverse cultures, innovative cuisine and great shopping. And lastly, because Justin Trudeau will always be better and hotter than Trump! BRB, heading to Vancouver, B.C. Canada. ✈️🇨🇦🙏🏾

It’s good to know that if I ever decided to go vegetarian or vegan that I would never have a shortage of places to dine at in Portland. I recently jogged from my neighborhood of NW all the way to Hawthorne (yeh, it was a mood) solely to check out @wholism_pdx which is a new plant-based eatery focused on ingredients in their most natural form that are grain-free, gluten-free, and free of refined sugars - a change from my normal diet. After that long jog, it was very rewarding to sit down to a hot pot of fresh steeped herbal tea. I paired their spicy basil tofu and quinoa with the house made kimchee (amazing) which all together was spot on flavorful and spicy yet refreshing. 🥥
Although they do have delicious smoothies and fresh baked goods, I opted for their coconut muesli as dessert which was a light and creamy mix of their slow cultured coconut yogurt, fresh fruit and grain free raw muesli. The space is reflective of their food. Clean, bright, airy and calming. Their motto is simple yet so true: “Let’s change the way we eat, live and treat each other.” 🙏🏾

Just because I’m on a diet doesn’t mean I can’t live! We all deserve a little treat every once in awhile and I found mine at @cremacafe in the form of a 16 oz. Mexican mocha. Question: do people in Mexico actually refer to it as a Mexican mocha? 🇲🇽 ☕️🙏🏾

Can someone please accidentally drop a slice of bread in my mouth and then top it off with some jam or butter or even vegemite at this point? I’m still on this no bread kick and it’s really showing me a weird side of myself that I kinda new existed but didn’t realize that a lack of bread and carbs could rear. I’m dreaming of the huge breakfast burrito and toast with a generous spread of avocado from my go to hood spot @clearingcafe Oh bread, I hope you know how much I miss you so! 🥺+🍞=❤️

You’ll have to forgive me if I’ve been a little snippy the past couple of days. You see, I recently cut out bread and major carbs so I’m a little on edge and as a result, been saying/doing things that I don’t mean 😒 I feel like I’m also having random hallucinations - seeing things that aren’t there. For instance, is this cauliflower what I have in my hand or buttery, flakey croissants from @sthonorebakery ?! Also, is butter a carb? I miss bread! 🥐🥖🍞🥧🧁🍰🍩🍪😭😒😕

‘Tis the season...for kimchee soup. Is kimchee really an acquired taste? I mean it’s just fermented veggies with spices. 🤷🏽‍♂️Nowadays people seem to be more accepting of the spicy Korean condiment. I’ve seen plenty of innovative non-Asian restaurants create and list their own on their menus and it’s amazing. But for some reason there was always a stigma about kimchee when I was younger. You were never able to find it at just any store or any random restaurant for that matter, and it always seemed to be the butt of jokes when kids would make fun of Asian kids saying that they “smelled like kimchee”. But really we were the ones making fun of the ‘basic’ kids cause they were forced to eat dry meatloaf or unseasoned chicken every night, while we were eating exotic and authentic cultural dishes. 😂 
My mom never made our own growing up, but we always had a big jar of it in our fridge which we would purchase from one of the local Asian markets that we frequented. She would make kimchee soup in the colder months right around the cold & flu season and I always thought that it was her specific recipe that no one else made. Come to find out as I got older that kimchee soup is a common Korean dish. My favorite in Portland is from @bibi2go_pdx which also happens to be my favorite and go-to Korean fast food restaurant that is family owned and operated and only several blocks away from my apartment. The soup is equally reminiscent of my moms which is already a winner for me but the family that operates it also show the same love and hospitality which makes it a more special experience and it always feels like little piece of home. 🙏🏾🍜❤️

If you’ve ever wanted a reason for people to purposely avoid human contact with you or happen to be a 16-year old school girl whose high school is built on top of the fiery entrance to hell and your guidance counselor informs you that it’s your destiny too fight off vampires, other evil demons and infernal creatures in an effort to save not just your hometown of Sunnydale but also the entire world while trying to balance friendships, boy drama and just the every day struggles of high school...then you should order the Napalm Breath from @sizzlepie . This pizza is topped with crushed garlic pepperoni, red onions (I added mushrooms), jalapeños and even more crushed garlic which is enough to slay all those pesky vampires away. 🙏🏾🍕💁‍♀️🧛🏻‍♂️⚰️🗡

There are 2 types of people in this world...the ones who can cook, and the ones who order out. I know my rightful place so I usually just stay my hungry ass out of the kitchen. That said, anytime I get a chance to grill I usually make an attempt to do so. As islanders grilling is in our blood and growing up I watched both my parents cook up some mean bbq and can still remember a thing or 2. And to be honest, it’s really quite simple as you have all the control. Look, I’m no #ironchef here and this was like a 5 ingredient meal capable of being prepared by even a caveman but as someone been known to burn water this is a win for me. 👨🏽‍🍳♨️🙏🏾

Finally got a chance to dine at @nicholasrestaurantgrand which was voted “Best Restaurant” of 2018 by the the readers poll of @willametteweek earlier this year and let me just say If you’re looking for authentic Mediterranean or Middle Eastern cuisine, then go here! I think 
that there are far too many restaurants out there that tend to focus more on the aesthetics of the interior and presentation of what can instagram better than too actually put the time and effort into properly paying tribute to showcasing the food 
of the respective culture(s), whatever those may be. I’m a firm believer in everyone being able to create, learn and share in other cultures and to bring diversity to the the table, both politically and culinarily. That said and in my opinion, the food tends to always tastes better and is frankly more affordable when it’s being cooked and represented by an actual family of that ethnic background. Not everyone can get it right. 😬🙏🏾

What a magical weekend at the Oregon Coast with Chris and koko. We stayed overnight and thanks to local Portland based blogger, foodie and friend @perfectfooddays we were introduced to @shelterednook which is a property of tiny homes situated on Tillamook Bay in the aptly named town of Bay City just 5 minutes outside Tillamook and and only moments from the sandy beaches and breathtaking views of the coast. These 6 tiny yet spacious homes are pet friendly with each unique space offering fully stocked and functional kitchens, bathrooms, master bedrooms with queen size beds and loft spaces with additional beds or sofa sleepers as well as private decks with propane gas grills. But what we really loved and appreciated was the warm hospitality and great attention to detail: custom toiletries for those who forget; hot cocoa, cider and coffee for those late nights by the fire pit or early mornings on the deck; individual wifi for each house for those who prefer to stay connected; smart tv’s with Netflix for those who want to “chill” (popcorn included); 3 tap handles with local beers along with all local Oregon wines, Tillamook ice cream and other beverages/treats for purchase. A complimentary breakfast basket is delivered to each house for the amount of mornings you will be staying and includes a more charming and upgraded version of the typical and boring continental breakfasts. Every evening just as the sun goes down a fire is prepared in the courtyard that centers all 6 tiny homes with chairs surrounding that is open to all guests to enjoy, converse and share stories. It’s clear that the owner Dee and her family built this place with a sense of warmth, love and community. She was so welcoming to us and even prepped a hot doggy bath for Koko since she knew we had just came back from the beach. We felt as if we were guests in their own home. If you ever find yourself on the Oregon Coast or just needing a little R&R break from the routine, stay here! 🙏🏾🏡🐶👬

Can you believe that I dined at a restaurant that is named after the one ingredient I hate the most, Fish Sauce! Ok, hate really is a strong word when you think about it, so let’s go with dislike. I have a weird relationship with Asian food cause I love eating food from the the southeast region but I don’t eat seafood and fish sauce is a main ingredient in most if not all of the more prominent dishes out there. I just can’t stomach the smell nor the taste which made it for an even more unique experience on my trip to Thailand this past July. Anyhow, I recently enjoyed some tasty happy hour @fishsaucepdx which is a Vietnamese restaurant (sister to @shortroundpdx - see earlier post) that serves up homestyle eats - the type of delicious food you would enjoy if you are ever so lucky to be invited into a traditional Vietnamese home. Now I know what you’re thinking, how ridiculous of me to go into a restaurant named after the one ingredient I dont eat and expect them to change dishes for me and I completely agree. Luckily, despite the restaurants namesake, there are items on the menu that are either made without fish sauce or can easily be altered to leave it out. And let’s be real here...at least I’m not a vegan dining in a steakhouse...not that there’s anything wrong with that. 🤦🏽‍♂️😬🙏🏾

Listen, I’m no basic B, but sometimes the flavor of pumpkin intrigues me especially when it’s in some sort of sweet dessert form. So you best believe that when I heard my old neighbors @pbjs_grilled who just opened their brick-n-mortar in the Pearl was serving a grilled pumpkin peanut butter sandwich with house made pie crust and caramel sauce on challah bread, I channeled that inner Taylor Swift hidden inside me and ordered it. And you know what, I’d do it again...sans Ugg boots. 🙏🏾🙋‍♀️🥪🍂 #lookwhatyoumademedo .

Unfortunately, TSA ruined my surprise and announced to Chris where I’m taking him for his relaxing birthday weekend before I could pull off the big reveal. However, we’re so excited to be getting out of cold ass Portland for a moment to enjoy some well needed time together with breakfast, lunch and cocktails by the pool topped off with an amazing dinner. If you need us, we’ll be down in sunny Palm Springs enjoying a relaxing weekend. Brb, putting life on a brief pause to seize the moment with my amazing partner. 🙏🏾🥂🛩🎉👬❤️

It’s Chris’ birthday today and sadly I had to work all day so I told him I would treat him to dinner tomorrow and that he just needed to pick the spot. He wanted to try some place new and since we’ve pretty much eaten at every single restaurant in Portland the only other option is to fly out of town and try a brand new place, right? Can’t wait to see his face when we get to the airport and he finds out where we’re going! 🙏🏾❤️🛩🥂🎉🎁

Did you know that James Beard award winning chef @ruckergabriel  highly acclaimed French bistro  @littlebirdpdx serves a delicious burger called the Double Brie Burger that was listed as one of the best burgers in all of Portland? Did you also know that this life changing burger is available 7 nights a week on their happy hour menu for only $7 along with various items such as chicken liver mousse (my fave in the city) and macaroni gratin (chris’ fave). Well did you??? Now you do. 🙏🏾🍔

People who hate on spam have either never had good spam musubi or need to try it. Honestly, it’s one of my favorite snacks and in this city, it’s hard to find a decent one. My favorite so far is at Island Grill downtown. Of course I couldn’t resist the amazing bulgogi with their creamy mac salad all of which remind me of my moms cooking growing up. And my favorite food is the one that takes me back home, so mahalo Island Grill for da love and the ono grinds! 🙏🏾🙌🏾❤️

I’m seriously not a fan of this dreary cold weather. I keep thinking of the warm summer days when I would take Koko to one of the many beautiful parks around the city for a relaxing picnic. Sadly, we are about 8 months away from that happening again but luckily @thepicnichouse has me covered, literally. And in honor of their new NW 23rd location opening 2 blocks away from my house, here’s a sampling of one of the many delicious American picnic style dishes that I had from their gorgeous Great Gatsby-esque location downtown. 🙏🏾

Great job to everyone who got out there and voted! ✊🏾 After yesterday’s long election, I think we can all use a sweet treat. So here you go! This tasty and well deserved masterpiece you’re looking at is from our friends at @boomcrepe in downtown. This isn’t just any other crêpe like you’ll find around the city, however. This is their signature: the Boom Crêpe, which has strawberries, bananas, Nutella, vanilla ice cream, whipped cream and a creme brûlée crust on top that is flambéed to order. 🤯 Yup, mind blowing! And since you spent all that time yesterday exercising (your right to vote) I’d say you earned yourself one...or 2. 🙏🏾🗳🤤

This season always messes with me. Between the cold weather and less sunlight it feels like I should eat more and go to be earlier. I think our bodies have a natural animalistic instinct to hibernate like that of bears. But then again, I usually trick myself into believing these sorts of things so that I can feel better about eating and drinking all of the things from local chocolatier @moonstruckchoc This is the perfect season to pop into one of their cafes for a hot sweet beverage and yummy treat. Don’t forget to incorporate the major C’s of the fall diet: chocolate, cocoa, and cookie cakes. 🙏🏾🐻☕️🍪🍰😴

I voted!
I voted because I’m a person of color and despite being born in Hawaii I’ve been told several times to go back to my own country. I voted because despite my dad being retired US Army and currently serving for the US Coast Guard, I’ve been told that me and my family should go back to our own country. I voted because I am gay and like everyone else want the basic human rights and to feel safe holding my partners hand. I voted because most of my friends are women and they all deserve to make their own decisions with their bodies. I voted because I have friends in the Trans community who fear that the few rights that they have may be taken away. I voted because my black friends really do think that their lives don’t matter. I voted for the voices who can’t. I voted because it’s patriotic. I voted because i believe that this country is the greatest country on earth and I know that we can do better. I voted because I’m a proud American and it’s my right to vote and because my vote counts. 🙏🏾🗳

Thinking about the delicious eats I had from @figliapdx Spicy chai tea ✅ Avocado toast ✅ Chorizo breakfast burrito ✅ Oatmeal with fresh fruit and cocoa nibs ✅ The only thing I could’ve asked for was a bed to nap in...which technically they have next door at @rejuvenationportland Anyhow, don’t forget to go vote everyone! 🙏🏾 🗳 .

Trick, Treat or Saigon Street Food Eats? I’ll take the latter thank you very much. Enjoy this beautiful spread of food as I did before gobbling it all up! I’m thinking about taking a trip to Vietnam next year so I popped over too @shortroundpdx to get some inspiration and feast on the delicious flavors of authentic Vietnamese food. Everything was amazing but I’m a sucker for a good Bahn mi sandwich and their Chinese sausage with runny fried egg was heavenly!!! One thing that’s missing is their house made soft served frozen yogurt which was sold out by the time I got there. However, since their menu is pretty extensive, I was too full for dessert by the time I was done with all this anyway. Do yourself a favor and check this place out for their killer happy hour deals and thank me later. Happy Halloween! 🙏🏾

I’m layered up on my couch in rainy Portland with a big cup of hot tea wishing I was back in sunny Palm Springs lounging poolside @theinglesideinn I’ve traveled a lot this year and this has to be my favorite resort/hotel property that I have been fortunate enough to stay at so far. From the moment I arrived to the gated tranquil oasis I knew that I was in desert paradise. With only a quick 10-minute drive from the airport this beautiful 30-room Spanish colonial style retreat is situated at the foothills of the Sonoran Desert Mountains beneath the lush swaying greens of the mile high palm trees. The grounds were as immaculate and detailed as the service. From the friendly and warm greeting at check-in to the personalized and attentive service by the pool, my needs were always met and my goal for a care-free relaxing weekend was achieved. Although the property sits 1 block away from the main attractions of Palm Canyon Drive, I felt as if I were hidden deep in the desert and wrapped neatly in a mirage as I couldn’t even tell that we were steps from downtown. I’m still mind blown about their martini service where you select what style of martini you want and a time for it to be delivered and prepared at your door. 
I’m looking forward to booking another weekend getaway here for some R&R and of course an amazing meal at the iconic Melvyn’s restaurant. Definitely add this to your list of places to play and stay when in PS. 🙏🏾🌴☀️

It’s no secret that Palm Springs is recognized for its mid-century modern architecture and design aesthetics. So it comes as no surprise that they would have  @workshopkitchenbar a James Beard award winning restaurant for design. The space displays a minimalistic, sleek and modern interior with dark stone and slate grays creating a very industrial feel hence the name. It’s cold, but in an intentional way. The food is American contemporary sourced with local ingredients and the menu is made up mostly of small plates for sharing or trying different items. I have to say though, that the meal seemed just ok to me. The duck I ordered didn’t stand out and fell flat which is a shame cause I love duck. The burrata tartine with heirloom tomatoes presented well, but avocado toast is avocado toast. Perhaps next time I go I’ll be a little more adventurous in ordering...one things for sure, they’re certainly deserving of that design award. 🙏🏾

In many parts of Palm Springs you can still see and even feel the days of old Hollywood, an era of glamour. A time when men wore tuxedos and women wore diamonds with couture gowns and showed up 20 minutes late to their dinner reservations at swanky and exclusive eateries to get drunk on champagne and martinis and party the night away. I did this the other night. Well, minus the champagne and martinis bit...oh and switch out the tuxedo for a suit...also, I was on time for my reservation at iconic Melvyn’s Restaurant located in the @theinglesideinn (where I was staying). Named after celebrated restauranteur and humanitarian Melvyn Haber, this Palm Springs institution has hosted presidents and royalty like Gerald Ford and celebrities like Frank Sinatra, Sonny & Cher and Rita Hayworth to name a few. It certainly begs the question, if these walls could talk. Dinner was delightful as expected, with table side service for their delicious wilted spinach salad and the classic bananas fosters for dessert, but the main course was one of their signature dishes, Melvyn’s chicken pot pie. Now I know that doesn’t sound very upscale, but this dish rivals any pot pie I’ve ever had before. The service was exceptional and the interior elegant. So this is what it’s like to dine like a celebrity. 🙏🏾🤵🏽✨

I’ve officially declared it summer. Or at least, I’ve extended it for myself. Landed from cold ass Portland and headed straight to @theinglesideinn where I’ll be hiding out for the next couple days. I’m so in awe with this amazing property and will have a great write up about it later, but first, a late lunch and cocktails by the pool - much needed and deserved! 🙏🏾🕶🌴☀️🍹

Alright Portland, I just kicked my ass this past week running and cycling and now it’s my weekend and you’re getting cold on me so I’m leaving you behind for some sun! A massage, dinner and a nap by the pool is calling my name. If anyone needs me, I’ll be in Palm Springs wearing big sunglasses, a scarf and checking myself into a resort for “exhaustion” under the name Demi Lohan-Bynes. 🕶🌴☀️

Keep your drinking buddies close and your friends who will inspire you, motivate you and force you to wake up at 6 am to run several miles in the cold, closer. 🙏🏾🏃🏾‍♂️💪🏾🏅

Morning run followed by a delicious and healthy(ish) lunch from my favorite neighborhood butcher shop @phils.meatmarket I love this place cause there’s so much history behind the walls as it’s been around since 1979 and it also has that friendly old-school, everyone knows everyone vibe. Like they know your order and throw in a couple scraps of bacon for your dog whose name they also know...that type of place. But I specifically come her for their grilled bento. They have a grill in front of the store that cooks up fresh 8-hour house marinated bbq Mon-Sat and that smoky sweet scent just fills the air and draws you in. I usually get the chicken or beef stacked on top a generous portion of brown rice with sweet chili sauce. On nice days, Chris and I will usually stop here to grab a couple bentos after a day of hiking up and around Washington Park as it’s situated right below. Man how I miss summer! 😕🙏🏾🍢

Don’t you just hate it when you go somewhere for one thing and end up ordering half the menu!!? Or is that just me? Chris and I took Koko 🐶 on a relaxing day trip to the beautiful city of Hood River located on the banks of the Columbia River Gorge. After a nice drive and a day filled with playing/relaxing on the beach we made our way deeper into town and away from all of the touristy spots and breweries downtown. Don’t get me wrong, there are some great restaurants in downtown HR, but we wanted something a little more authentic and I read about one of the best tortas in the Gorge which is prepared at family owned and operated Lake Taco. This is a very small, off the beaten path restaurant located above the valley and is definitely a spot that only locals would know about. I was feeling adventurous and ordered the lengua (beef tongue) tacos, but they were all out out, so we did the chicken and pork, along with their signature burrito, garnachas, and the life changing chili-dipped torta pambazo  stuffed with chorizo and potatoes👊🏾which was by far the best torta I’ve ever had. 10/10 would go again. If you’re ever out in then ”Hood” or just taking a drive through one of the countries most natural and beautiful scenic canyons, be sure to add this place to your list. Lewis and Clark would’ve dined here, and so should you! .

Just ran a 10k (8-ish) for the first time since the start of the summer and holy ish...I am out of shape, again. After I got back from Thailand this summer I just stopped training and started traveling/eating more and got out of the routine.😬 it’s crazy how fast your body can forget if you just give up a little, but I’m ready to push and get motivated again. Just cause the seasons are changing doesn’t mean my health has too. Thanks @moberi for always having my back! 🙏🏾🏃🏾‍♂️💪🏾

I just completed my first ever cycle class this morning and ohhhhhh my gawd...I tip my hat to all you cyclists out there cause that ish is not easy! That said, I’ve already signed up for the next class. Cause you know what they say, torture makes perfect! Biking 14 miles and actually not going anywhere in 1-hour can really build up an appetite and the only thing that I was craving was @thewholebowlpdx for a savory and healthy lunch. I’m a huge fan of rice bowls and this is one of my favorites as it’s loaded with: brown rice, black and red beans, avocado, cilantro, olives, Tillamook cheddar, sour cream, salsa and Tali sauce 👊🏾 All the needed ingredients to jump start my day on this beautiful fall Monday! 🙏🏾🚲🍛💪🏾

Two things most people don’t know about me: 1) I don’t know how to swim. And number 2) I don’t eat seafood.🤯 I know...I’m quite a disgrace to my people and the entire island community. But I consider myself a rare breed - a unicorn of sorts if you will. So it’s highly unlikely that you will ever see me more than waist deep in water or ever find me dining in a sushi restaurant. That being said, I was initially drawn to the latest sushi spot @fishnrice mainly for their aesthetics as it’s the cutest little restaurant that’s tucked neatly above the busy shopping district of NW 23rd and happens to be a couple blocks away from my house. But after researching their menu, I found a decent and delicious selection of vegetarian sushi that I just had too try and I have too say, as a full-time carnivore that dabbles as a vegetarian from time to time, I was pleasantly satisfied. And if you needed more convincing, they also have a great list of Japanese whisky, Sake, and a Nintendo. 🙏🏾🍣🎮

Ok look, I’m all for being open minded when it comes to food...but too me, there are some things that should just be left alone: watermelon should not be spicy, ice cream flavors should not resemble the scents of perfume, and bacon flavor should only exist on...well, bacon. Hey, call me a traditionalist if you want! This brings me to Portland’s @bing.mi a food truck that specializes in 1 thing: Jian Bing, which is a savory crêpe. I always thought that crêpes should only be sweet until I tried this delicious dish for the first time which dates back 2000 years ago from the Shandong region of China. This ingenious creation is made of: scrambled eggs, black bean paste, chili sauce, pickled veggies, green onions, cilantro, and a crispy fried cracker in a made too order crêpe. The balance of texture and flavor in this seemingly simple dish is spot on perfection. And since it pretty much includes a decent amount of the main food groups, we can just go ahead and call this breakfast. 🙏🏾🍳

Today was one of those beautiful fall days where you grab a good book and sit in a corner with a hot pot of tea and some snacks. The Swedes call it Fika...I call it a relaxing afternoon. Thank you for the warmth @miette1965 🙏🏾☕️🍮

I finally had barbecue at the best food cart in Portland. No really, @keesloadedkitchen was voted the “Best Food Cart” of 2018. I’m gonna go ahead and say that this is the best bbq that I’ve ever had here in the City of Roses. Couple of tips: get there as early as you can - cause she’ll sell out! If you see a line of people which resembles the length of a TSA line, you’re in the right spot. There’s no assigned menu to order from. It’s 1 big plate for $25 that Kee decides the night before what she will be serving that day and its always a delicious surprise. I came on a heavenly day, cause when we rolled up I excitedly asked her, “what’s good today Kee?” Her response: “we’ve got smoked ribs, hot links, brisket, fried chicken, macaroni salad, sweet corn, bbq beans, sweet potato pie, hot roll and cherry limeade!” 👊🏾 All of this comes served with a generous complimentary side of southern hospitality. This was simply...fucking amazing!!🙏🏾🙌🏾

I had a usual craving for Thai food (what else is new) but I wanted a specific dish: Khao Man Gai which surprisingly is not found at most Thai restaurants and if so, its not as good as @nongskhaomangai . In fact, this is the only dish that you will find on the menu here at Nong’s which is a clear indication that she has perfected it. Most people don’t know that Khao Man Gai actually hails from China but was popularized by the people of Bangkok which is the city in Thailand from where Nong was born and raised. And in 2003 with only $70, 2 suitcases and a dream, Nong migrated from Bangkok to Portland leaving behind a life of poverty and abuse with the hope of seeking a better future. It is here in Portland where she found a job waiting tables in a family run Thai restaurant teaching while herself English and then ultimately becoming a cook at Andy Ricker’s famed Pok Pok and was able to save enough money to buy and start her own food cart, which would eventually spawn 2 successful restaurants and her own delicious signature sauce (always in my fridge) sold at local high end grocers on both sides of the coast. To some people, this is just chicken and rice...the best damn chicken and rice. But for many others, this is hope that they too can have the American Dream. Thank you for sharing your story Nong. 🙏🏾🍛

It’s #tacotuesday and I’m thinking about these unique sweet taco-like treats that I had back in Bangkok. It’s kind of hard to explain what these were, but all I know is that I only saw them at MBK and that they were handmade, unlike anything I’ve had before and quite good. 🙏🏾🌮

Of course as soon as summer ends I finally start getting back the motivation to run, exercise and eat healthier as if I’m gonna be walking around in shorts and a tank top for winter 😒 oh well, whatever the case is, at least I’m getting back on that health kick, or trying too. I crossed the river which is already a big deal for me so that I could finally brunch at @lalunacafepdx ! The food and service were great and the space was cute and charming. Anytime I brunch I usually get something healthy and then something sorta-kinda not, which lead me to order their super delicious açaí bowl which had avocado and is the first time I’ve ever had that in an açaí bowl but it worked! Of course fat me just had to have bread, so I also ordered their yummy turkey sando 😕...but with a side salad cause I haven’t completely lost control 😊 Anyhow, this is place is great and side note: it’s the same people who own one of my favorite ono Hawaiian joints @ateohatepdx , so you already know this spot is good! Mahalo! 🙏🏾🥙🥪

Guys, I’m really trying to hold on to these last few days of decent summer-like weather. I’m just not ready for the rain and cold to come 😖Only 2 things I like about fall: layering clothes and fall menu changes. This is the time where most restaurants start changing all of their menus over to reflect fall inspired ingredients, and I love all the warm, sweet comforting flavors and colors of fall. I finally made it to @sugarpinedrivein which is located on the banks of the Sandy River below the beautiful canyons of historic Columbia Gorge and where gay-icon and fearless feminist Sacagawea famously bitch slapped Lewis and Clark for eating their last ration of peanut butter m&m’s. 💅🏾 I was lucky to visit on the first day of their fall menu change and ordered their delicious caramel apple & pear crisp paired with vanilla soft serve and miso caramel. It was pretty much Christmas in a cup. I love how cute and quaint this place is, tucked away in the middle of the sticks and outdoor seating only which gives you a nice breath of fresh nature. 🙏🏾🍦🍨🌲🍃⛰

One of the tricks to a successful relationship is sharing. Take these pizzas for example: I tend to be more adventurous when eating and always go spicy while Chris likes more classic and subdued spice levels, so he ordered the Margherita pizza while I ordered the fennel sausage w/ Mama Lil’s peppers knowing that if I offered a slice of mine too him he would politely decline and that I will always accept a slice of his cause I eat everything. So in the end, we both offered to share and he ended up sacrificing a slice of one his for me. See! Sharing and sacrifice! 2 tips for a healthy relationship! Wait...that’s not relationship advice, that’s actually a trick to getting extra pizza! You’re welcome! 😬Thanks to the team @lifeofpiepizza and welcome to the NW District. We finally got a legit wood-fired pizza joint in the hood! 🙏🏾🍕👨‍❤️‍👨❤️

The hype is real! @pufflewafflespdx is out here giving us life through ice cream. And in a city where artisan ice creameries reign, Puffle Waffle takes it one step further with fresh made to order puffy waffles as cones which is a reinvention of the classic waffle cone. It’s edible art really, delicious art! Summer may officially be over, but ice cream is always in season! 🙏🏾🍦

Had an awesome time yesterday taking koko to her favorite farm @bellaorganicfarm We spent nearly 4-hours there hanging out with the farm animals from @heart2heartfarm riding on the cow train, getting lost in the maze, having lunch and catching up with good friends. We always come here mid-week and early cause this place gets super busy on the weekends which is also when their haunted maze is open. We love how well kept the grounds are and how everyone here is super friendly. Also, their hand-made hand pies are the best thing ever washed down with one of their hard ciders! (I ate 2 pies way too fast before I realized I didn’t take a photo😕) 🙏🏾 🎃🥧🍺

Guess who’s back in the hood!? My neighbors @moberi moved from their iconic NW 23rd stand to a beautiful new space in the new Beesaws building only 2 blocks down! Today only for their grand opening it’s free açaí bowls and vegan soft serve which they just debuted at this flagship location! Get in and get yours while they last from 12-4pm!

You know what Portland needs? More late night dessert options! It amazes me that we have such an amazing variety of good food here, but no one has yet to open up a food cart or shop dedicated to just desserts that’s open late, and I mean stoner late! I’ve been filling that void at @angels_donuts on NE Alberta. I love this place because not only is it open till 12 am, but it’s simple. You get what you pay for. It’s really not like all these hipster donut shops that charges $5 for a sub par sugary cake - nothing “artisan” here. This is cheap, easy and friendly. They also serve up local @tillamook ice cream and are not stingy on the toppings or sauces. This is a place where you stop by on your morning commute, grab a donut and a coffee and be on your way - it’s a “if you don’t like it, go somewhere else” type of spot. And I love that realness......🙏🏾🍩

How’s your Taco Tuesday game working out for you!? Thanks to my friend and local San Diego foodie @natashasfoodadventures I’d say I’m doing pretty good. She suggested that I visit @saludtacos in historic Barrio Logan and I’m so glad I did I! The food here is amazing - fresh, cheap, delicious and plentiful! It pays homage to Northern Mexico cuisine with a Chicano attitude and style. I always say, if there’s a line out the door then it must be good! 🙏🏾🌮

An amazing dinner by Executive Chef Brian Redizkowski from @kettnerexchange His food is what you would expect from a Chef with an extensive culinary background which includes: New York’s famed Le Cirque, as well as working alongside highly decorated Chef, Joel Robuchon (rip🙏🏾). Many international flavors make up his menu from China to South America, the food is quite bright, flavorful, spicy and rich. The standout dish for me was the sous vide double cut pork chop served with crushed potatoes, carrots, brussel sprouts with a mild and tangy Peruvian glaze - tender, juicy and delicious. The space was gorgeous, boasting award winning architecture whose design pays homage to one of San Diego’s founding fathers William Kettner. The service was detailed, friendly, professional....

An easy flight to San Diego and a delicious breakfast to start the day off. @breakfastrepublic happened to be located blocks away from our hotel and I read about some delicious things they do, so we stopped by. Add this to your brunch list when in SD. Food is fresh, local, creative, plentiful and true showcase of Southern Californian cuisine with attentive and friendly service. Now excuse me while I order another cocktail by the pool. 🙏🏾🛩☀️🍹

It’s the last day of @feastportland and all of it’s events and I’m still pouting about not being able to participate. So while I have my pitty party of 1, I’ll also think about that week I flew to Denver and went to locals only spot, Pete’s Kitchen at 2 am and ordered their signature breakfast burrito which is stuffed with everything you can think of. It’s no wonder Colorado was the first state to legalize marijuana...cause if you can roll up a fat burrito like this, than you can certainly roll up a fat.....😂🌯

I think I’m the only food fanatic that’s actually not participating in any of the Portland Feast festivities this week due to work 😕 So, here’s a picture of some amazing Thai food I had when I was in Chiang Mai in July. This was during the volunteer project I did with the elephants. We were perched high in the jungly mountains above the river staring down at the elephants and having lunch that was prepared by one of the sweet local women we encountered. It was a magical time, one that I haven’t forgotten and certainly never will. 🐘🙏🏾❤️ .

I was told by a friend that I had to check out @lotusofsiam any time I’m in Vegas as this is a destination for foodies and food industry people alike, so I did. And since I’m not one to ever waste time when it comes to food, I made a beeline directly  from the airport with luggage in hand. I got there just before the crazy lunch rush and bellied up right at the bar with excitement. The food here is Thai if you haven’t guessed by the name with a focus on the northern region of the country specifically Chiang Mai, a place that I once spent time in and is where chef/owner Saipin Chutim hails from. The recipes are a 100 year old legacy and celebration of the women that came before her, grandmothers and great grandmothers, on both her and her husbands side. It’s a true telling of the style of northern Thai cuisine: simple, spicy herbaceous and done effortlessly. In 2011, Chef Chutima was awarded the coveted James Beard award for “Best Chef in the Southwest” becoming the first Asian American woman to ever receive the title, and frankly for me, was enough to get me to sit in her restaurant. But if you need more convincing, try her amazing Khao Soi topped with crispy duck which makes it her signature dish you surely won’t find anywhere else. Khao Soi, if done right, can really transport you to the mountainous jungles of Chiang Mai and all of the north, but Chef Chutima’s twist by adding crispy fried duck really gives it an edge of bolder texture and flavor. Another signature dish is the Nam Kao Tod which is crispy rice with pork sausage, cilantro, green onions, grounded dried chili, ginger, peanuts and lime juice which make for an epic way to kick start your palate in preparation for the amazing journey Chef Chutima has prepared for you. This place is constantly ranked as one of the best Thai restaurants in the country, and now you’ll just have to go see for yourself. 🙏🏾

I’m super excited to be heading out of Portland today, not only because it just started to rain, but because of the amazing night planned ahead. I’m just not quite ready to let go of summer. Beyond humbled and grateful to leave this dreary weather behind for some hot sun, amazing food and a relaxing nap by the pool. BRB, heading to Vegas! 🙏🏾😎☀️🌴

Had my first dining experience at an “eatuary” which is a mortuary turned eatery. At least that’s how restaurant @lingerdenver defines it. This massive space which now caters to the hungry living was sure enough once home to the dead long before the owners decided to flip the space and turn it into one of Denver’s hottest and liveliest (see what I did there) restaurants. The menu focus here is interpreted street food from around the globe. It highlights the unique international flavors that are found deep from the streets and alleyways that make up a majority of the 7 continents. I of course nibbled my way through Asia and ordered the fried chicken bao and chicken satay lettuce wraps and kept it PG-13 with a refreshing non alcoholic mocktail called the New Saigon. If for some reason you can’t seem to find anything on the menu (you’re officially picky) then head upstairs to their sprawling rooftop terrace equipped with a view of beautiful downtown Denver and a food truck! Yes, an entire food truck on the roof serving more international cuisine! Denver is lit ya’ll, and it should be on your next food destination list. 🙏🏾

I’m still dreaming about the American Dream...no, not that one 😒...the dessert that’s created by award winning pastry chef and former host of the Food Network series, The Food Network Challenge - Chef Keegan Gerhard at his stylish restaurant @dbardenver in downtown Denver. This is THE place to get desserts when you’re in the Mile High City when craving something sweet but also looking for something well made. The menu is very playful yet inventive with a focus on “upscale comfort foods.” But my focus was on his delicious award winning desserts and nothing brought me more comfort then his whimsical presentation of the classic funfetti cake topped with buttercream paired with a mini-sundae and an eggbeater with yet more buttercream for you to relive those childhood days of racing your siblings to the kitchen to “lick the spoon”. That’s what we called it in my house anyway. This was another food experience that took me on a trip down memory lane. To a simpler time in my youth...when me and my metabolism had no idea what carbs even were ( #idontknowher ) 💅🏾It’s pretty serendipitous really, cause I’ve actually had cravings for funfetti cake lately and of course I come to Denver and find this gem! ✨🍰 🙏🏾

Had a delicious meal with an amazing view @elfivedenver Completely unobstructed , I sat  eye-level of the cities skyline and enjoyed tapas style small bites and gazed as day quickly faded to night. This gorgeous space is located just west of downtown in the vibrant LoHi District and is a hip and modern eatery that draws out the sophisticated and stylish Denverites. The food here explores all the countries in the Mediterranean region of the Strait of Gibraltar. It’s a delicious and easy way for the land-locked  residents of Denver to leave the Rocky Mountains for a trip through the aqua blue waves of the Mediterranean coast. My fresh fruit sangria which had Colorado peaches paired quite well with my favorite dish: Jamón Ibérico which was 18-month aged acorn-fed Ibérico ham with pan con tomate and grilled bread. This was certainly not a bad way to spend a summer evening in the Mile High City. 🙏🏾

Let me tell you about the best fried rice I’ve ever had. It’s tucked away at a cute little brunch spot called @onefold_denver on the outskirts of downtown. Everything here is organic and locally sourced. But back to that fried rice. It’s cooked to order in bacon grease, with bacon, garlic, green onions, tamari soy sauce, and chili oil then topped of with 2 duck fat fried eggs. Are you still following along, or did I lose you at fried rice!? This changed my world and now my view on fried rice, and I better be able to find something as good as this when I get back home or it’s back and forth to and from Denver anytime I get a craving!!! 🙏🏾 🥓 🦆 🍳 🍚 .

I almost didn’t come to Denver. To be honest, Colorado isn’t really a state that I would’ve ever thought to visit. But after reading and learning about the  @comal_heritagefoodincubator I knew that I had to go and support. This casual lunch only spot serves authentic Latin American cuisine by different underprivileged women that represent the cultures and heritage of Mexico, El Salvador and Peru. It’s an outreach program whose goal is to provide these women the skills for entrepreneurship by teaching them marketing, financial literacy, computers and English. It empowers these women so that one day they can create their own ventures to become strong leaders and business owners in their community and be able to have a platform to do the same. 60% of all revenue go to them for their time and effort in creating the delicious food, and the other 40% goes to operational and educational costs. When you support local operations like this, it has a much deeper impact that goes well beyond what we can see. It creates better futures and communities and strengthens the net that supports not just women’s rights but women of color. Thank you for the amazing meal ladies and cheers to you! 🙏🏾✊🏾❤️

I love a good food hall and Denver has plenty to choose from. Perhaps the most popular one is @denvermilkmarket which is located downtown steps away from @thecoorsfield Created and curated by local celebrity chef Frank Bonanno, this massive hall not only showcases an array of all local restaurants and bars, but local merchants and retailers as well. I hopped up to the counter at Lou’s Hot Naked and ordered the popular Lou’s Plus which is a crispy chicken breast with American cheese, lettuce, tomatoes and pickle. Delicious! However, I opted for the spicy option assuming these mountain kids don’t know what spice is, and boy was I wrong! The spice on that chicken was next level and washing it down with a cold can of Xing Iced Tea was the only thing holding my pride in tact. 🔥🔥🔥😩

Just finished 60 hours of working with the best restaurant team in Portland and after a 2-hour nap and 1 cup of coffee, I have the privilege of jumping on to a plane to go dine and explore a new city. Cheers to all the businesses that observe this day as a day of rest for the hard working professionals who continue to invest their lives into the daily labor of what we call work. And cheers to all of you who are currently working or making the trek in later today to take care of your communities and beyond. Should you need me, I’ll be eating my way through the Rocky Mountains! BRB, heading to Denver. Happy Labor Day. 🙏🏾

A huge thank you to the amazing team @hartscamp for a fun weekend. This is certainly my version of camping and I think that Koko would agree. It’s an awesome way to still experience the beautiful Oregon Coast but not have to worry about the stress of camping, like packing and setting up. Everything was already there waiting for us and we were able to use our precious time to explore and create memories. Also, that heated outdoor shower was ahhhh-mazzing! ❤️🙏🏾🐶🏕

What an amazing and relaxing weekend Chris and I had. We love getting out of the city as much as we can to explore more of beautiful Oregon and it’s scenic landscape. The Pacific Northwest truly is a magical place and we’re so grateful to call it home. The best part is that we were able to have Koko 🐶with us and she absolutely loves to explore. We still have many more days of summer and beautiful weather left everyone, hope you’re able to get out there to wander, explore and create some memorable adventures! 🙏🏾🐶👬🏕⛰

Wanna know where to get one of the biggest burritos I’ve ever had in my life? It’s about a 2 hour drive west of Portland located in Lincoln City on the beautiful Oregon Coast at @superoscars This family owned and operated fast food Mexican spot serves up mostly authentic dishes but 
with super generous portions. Mexican dishes are already known for being huge and Super Oscars doesn’t want you to forget that. In fact they told me that the Tsunami Burrito ($13.99) which is a hidden menu item, can serve up to 4 people...little did they know who they were serving it too! This concoction is stuffed full of your choice of meat (we chose carne asada) bacon, potatoes, rice, lettuce, sour cream and cheese 😋. Can you believe that Chris and I ordered this massive thing and scarfed down every bite with no irony whatsoever!? 😬 I guess I never thought of myself as a size queen until now. Check em out next time you’re passing though or stopping by to catch some waves. 🌯🌯🌯🌯

Our attempt at barbecuing last night worked in our favor, and we didn’t have to dine out!!! I can shamefully admit that I do not know how to cook, which is quite sad cause growing up I watched and even helped my mom in the kitchen cook and prepare delicious islander food, but apparently nothing but the rice ever stuck. Or perhaps, my fate was always to dine out in restaurants 🤷‍♂️ Whatever the case may be, at least I was slightly able to remember how to bbq which in island culture is mandatory as we barbecue for every single occasion. Nothing extravagant here, just some marinated chicken breasts and vegetable kabobs with salad. This would totally and utterly taste like crap if I were making this back home in the city, but something about being “outdoors” and “camping” that made this meal taste almost Michelin worthy...oh yes, it was dried out rubbery chicken that reminded me of tires. 🤦‍♂️😬🍗🏕🐶

I don’t Camp, I Glamp! Chris and I decided on a weekend getaway to the beach and since we’re not outdoorsy people and have no concept of how to camp, we rented a fully stocked airstream trailer through @hartscamp in Pacific City, Oregon. Besides our own food and of course Koko’s toys and snacks, there really isn’t a need to bring anything else as the they provide it all, from flatware and stemware to a propane grill and firewood for our fire pit. The one thing I can’t live without when I go “camp” is a fully functioning bathroom and our airstream trailer not only has that, but an outdoor heated shower as well. The best part, we are literally across the street from the beach. We don’t know how to cook, so if our attempt to bbq fails, and I’m sure it will, you’ll find us on the beach having drinks and dinner at @pelicanbrewing Cheers to an relaxing weekend! 👬🐶🍷❤️🙏🏾

Have you been to @teote.pdx yet? There are 2 locations both with awesome patios but my favorite one is in the Alberta Arts District. The patio is huge and open year round as it’s enclosed and is really just an extension of the bar. The food is amazing. Latin American street food with an emphasis on arepas which are Venezuelan corn cakes that are paired with your choice of one of their marinated meats - the smoky pollo is 🔥 Aside from the delicious food the location on Alberta also has the biggest list of impressive hard to find Mezcal’s in Portland. Love the late night vibe here - good food, friendly service, hip atmosphere with 90’s rap/hip-hop...it’s definitely one of those places where you shouldn’t be surprised if a random dance party happens out of nowhere, especially after a couple shots of mezcal. 🙏🏾🥃

Of course no trip to San Francisco is complete with out dinner at famed eatery @garydankosf This classy institution, along with Chef Gary Danko himself, has won every coveted award possible and aside from receiving a Michelin Star for multiple consecutive years they’re also distinguished as a Relais and Château designation, which is 1 of only 18 in North America alone. The service was everything you would expect in a world-class fine dining atmosphere, tailored and led by a seasoned team of well educated professionals who guided me through four classic yet inventive French dishes. The dining room is simply elegant. Flowing with gorgeous lush flowers and modern art work which is then offset by a warm glow of the soft golds that illuminate the well dressed patrons and wait staff as they maneuver around in a well choreographed dance, meeting the needs of each guest. It’s captivating. This is one of those restaurants that really doesn’t need any kind explanation as the name Gary Danko is an automatic “WOW” in the culinary and restaurant world. Dining here and even working here means you’ve arrived at the top. Cheers and a grateful thank you to the amazing team that created such a memorable dining experience for me. An experience that will last longer than the flavors of their delicious food. .

Not that I’m counting or anything, but I just had my 4th Michelin Star meal. I think when most people think of a Michelin starred restaurant they automatically think fine dining with white linen, rare Bordeaux wines and super small plates with super huge prices. This is not the case for the authentic Thai eatery @kinkhao located in downtown San Francisco. Think the exact opposite. This is a more causal joint located in the corner of the @parc55hotel and is quite unassuming but is very much in high demand and eating here without a reservation can cost you a missed opportunity to enjoy some traditional Thai flavors with fresh Californian ingredients. I got there 15 minutes before they opened and felt the rush of what a band groupie might feel like waiting outside of a dressing room. Ok...bad analogy. Luckily, my patience and will to eat good food paid off and I was seated right away before the hoards of people arrived and the waitlist without reservations began. The food here is simply delicious! And a true reminder of my personal and recent experience to the Land of Smiles. It was a humbling trip down memory lane and a tasty one too. If you come here, order the Pork Belly and get a big pot of white rice to slop up the very flavorful, sweet and spicy sauce that it comes soaking in. You’ll thank me later. 🙏🏾 🇹🇭 .

Mid-day snack while exploring China Town. Eastern Bakery is one of the most authentic Chinese bakeries I’ve ever visited and this was unplanned. I happened to stroll by and see several people crowding around the showcase so I decided to wander in knowing damn well My fat ass wouldn’t be leaving without ordering something. My eyes fixated on the butter cream buns [insert dirty joke here] and then a gentleman standing in line next to me said that he swears by them and it was the reason for his 45-minute drive from outside the city. They were fresh and hot - a brand new pan of scrumptious carbs! I quickly order 4 buns and as the kind lady is bagging them up I hand over my card when she informs me that it is cash only. Without hesitation, I tell her that I will find an ATM and be right back. I quickly make my way down the street to withdraw cash and scurry back thinking about those poor orphaned butter buns that I left abandoned and all alone. As I make my way into the bakery and back to the counter, that same old lady looks at me with surprise, and I could tell by her expression that she didn’t anticipate me coming back for those future love handles as she just sold them to someone more prepared; more deserving I imagine. I look back at the case and see 2 left and hand her my cash and at this point some new guy next to me points down to the same 2 - my 2!!! She looks at him then looks at me, then quickly bags them up and hands them over to me and explains to the unamused gentleman that I ordered first, and had it not been for his petty demeanor, i would’ve offered him one. Instead, without any remorse, I take one out and slowly take my time enjoying it while he searches the case for his back-up plan all the while cursing me out in his head I’m sure. And that ladies and gents, is how I almost died in China Town! 😂🙏🏾🤤

Breakfast this morning was amazing! After a quick flight, with a long BART ride from the airport to downtown, and then an Uber ride up the windy streets of Cole Valley, I settled down at Zazie for breakfast. Established in the year 1992 this place is a staple amongst the locals in the Bay Area and that was made clear to me as there was already a 20 minute wait for a table on this chilly summer morning. Luckily, they have an all-year round heated patio to keep you warm while you scarf down all  that your appetite can handle. My suggestion: the French Toast Tahiti which is stuffed with a generous filling of mashed bananas and walnuts - this was life changing and easily the best French toast I’ve ever had. The best part...this not only changed my life, but it also helped change the lives of their employees as well. Since Zazie is tip free, all of their prices include a livable wage which provides: full medical/dental insurance, paid sick time, paid vacation time, paid family time, and an employer matched 401(k) program which all happens to be the most comprehensive benefits plan than any other non-union restaurant! This is the main reason why supporting local businesses is important to me - so that every one gets an opportunity to reap the rewards. Cheers to owner Catherine Opoix for being a bad ass in shaping the lives of both her team and her community while changing the stigma of restaurant workers. 🙏🏾💖

Counting my lucky stars everyday ✨. I’m so fortunate to be able to live the life that I live and be able to do what I do: travel, explore, eat and see life from both sides of the table. I’m a self-proclaimed foodie and I don’t take myself too seriously...I’m not the best photographer and my content is all over the place. It’s a hobby and one that I enjoy and like to share with whoever chooses to listen. That said, I’m excited to take you guys on another food journey with me and what better place to explore than a food driven city filled with rich culture and diversity. BRB, heading to San Francisco. 🌉🙏🏾

Where my late night peeps at!? Listen up, I’ve got a spot to satisfy those 2 am munchies. @loveveronapizza downtown is a food cart tucked away in a sea full of food carts but this place serves up legit made to order pizza and pasta until 3 am every night. Each pizza is a generous 10” (for all you size queens 😜) and all under $11. The pastas are baked to pipping hot (all under $10) and are an entire meal in itself. So if you’re tired of waking up in shame surrounded by Taco Bell wrappers and hot sauce packets stuck to your forehead (that was 1 time!!!) than this should definitely be on your list of places for late night eats. And it’s about to get even better as I was informed that the owner just signed a lease for a brick-n-mortar to run a 24-hour spot downtown!!! Finally, a late night pizza joint that you don’t have to spend $30+ to get a mediocre pie served with a side of hipster attitude. 🙏🏾🍕🍕🍕

10-course dream @juniperandivy down in San Diego’s Little Italy. If you ever have the choice to sit at a chefs counter anywhere do it! In my opinion, it’s the best seat in the hose. Watching the chefs prep and execute each dish right in front of you is just a sight to see. I sat at the chefs pastry counter and witnessed all of creative desserts being prepared so you know I had to have one of my own at the end. Luckily for me, my gracious server Jessica sent over their signature dessert, called the Yodel. A delicious presentation with chocolate devils food cake, white chocolate and hazelnut brittle all encompassed in a an edible log that is revealed by pouring hot chocolate sauce over it. This was insanely delicious as was each whimsical course of their refined American cuisine. Helpful advice: Go to San Diego, come to this restaurant and sit with Jessica! 🙏🏾

If you didn’t already know, San Diego has a huge Latin influence as it sits about a stones throw away from Mexico. I was happy to see some diversity and culture down here and knew right away that I had to get my hands and my belly on some authentic Mexican food. And after a relaxing day at the beach, that’s just what I did. Luckily, my decision on what restaurant to visit was made almost 7 years ago by a friend of mine. Ponce’s Mexican restaurant is a family owned and operated business located in the Kensington neighborhood just north of downtown San Diego. It’s an institution to say the least. One that has been serving authentic Mexican comfort food to the community and beyond for generations. Named after their patriarch, Señor Ponce Meza, what really made dining at Ponce’s special for me is that I happen to be friends with his daughter Rocio, who along with her brother, grew up in the walls of this restaurant helping shape the family legacy and then eventually moving to Portland, Oregon and opening her own restaurant which, you guessed it, is the ever popular and delicious @rociospdx !!! Rocio and her team do some amazing things in SE Portland, but what was cool to see is where her spirit and hospitality came from. If you ever find yourself in San Diego and want a true authentic Mexican meal created and served by a a true authentic Mexican family, be sure to check out Ponce’s! (And get the chicken enchiladas!) 🙏🏾

Well, in true me fashion I hopped right off the plane, jumped in an Uber and headed straight for a restaurant with luggage in tow, skipping the hotel check-in. First stop was the most important meal of the day brought to me by locally owned and operated @harborbreakfast_sd . This quaint and open-air gem is located right in the heart of Little Italy and serves some classic morning dishes, but is supposed to be know for their benedict’s which I can confirm that the rumor is true. Now there’s nothing mysterious or extraordinary that Chef Eddie Hernandez did here with my traditional eggs benedict with tavern turkey, but you can taste it’s freshness. It’s classic, it’s done right, it’s local, and it was the perfect way to start my mini sunny vacation in San Diego. Also, not only do they serve Portland, Oregon’s own @stumptowncoffee , but the history of the building is quite sorted and dramatic (I live for it!) let’s just say: the 70’s, politics, prostitution, arrest. 💅🏾

Off for the next 2 days and that crazy Portland heat wave is coming back so I decided last minute to leave this hot mess and head towards somewhere a little more tropical...or at least a place with a beach and some palm trees 🌴 will work. I’m low maintenance really 🤫Excited to explore a new city and check out some great restaurants. BRB, heading to San Diego. 😎☀️

Obviously I’d rather be on a beach in Mexico...or anywhere tropical really. But until then, we’ll always have #sauvieisland 
Thank you to @traderjoes for the delicious summer beach essentials. Everything we needed for a relaxing day of soaking up the sun with koko. (and girl, yes my fat ass brought an entire baguette to the beach💅🏾)

An easy distraction from the everyday monotony of life. Don’t you wish this world could be as spicy, colorful, and flavorful as Thai food? As Thai culture!? I naturally gravitate towards more of the ethnic restaurants because I always find a sense of self and comfort there. I think that goes without saying especially since I’ve said it many times in previous posts. But because I don’t have the comforts of home (my moms cooking) readily available, i find that it’s easier for me to find that comfort in food from other cultural ethnicities especially ones that reflect similarly to my own. Also I just love Thai food, dammit! One of the best feelings you can have is returning to a restaurant and being remembered. Having the team warmly greet you like an old friend that you haven’t seen in a while, remembering your order and making you feel special. This is a sign that you’ve become a regular. This is the feeling you get when you’ve created a positive influence. That out of the hundreds of patrons they see during a day, you are one of the few that they are genuinely excited to see. And from that point on the good food just becomes an added bonus as you’re just happy to be in a place that feels like home. Thank you again Thai Chili Jam for the warm hospitality. 🙏🏾

Celebrated my 7th anniversary (that’s 35 in gay years) with my best friend, partner in crime, travel buddy and the love of my life. Thank you Chris for always being such a kind, supportive, wonderful and patient partner to me...seriously, you’re the only person I know that will sit and wait while our food goes cold so that I can stand on a chair in the middle of a restaurant and take numerous photos of our meal and then happily eat with me...that’s love. Traditionally, we would be flying down to Mexico right now to celebrate. But as he just started his new career and can’t take time off yet,we celebrated at @acenapdx his favorite Italian restaurant followed by ice cream at @rubyjewelicecream our favorite ice cream shop. If you haven’t been to A Cena (pronounces ah-chayna) then go! It’s rustic Italian, with hand made pastas, delicious local ingredients, warm hospitality in an intimate setting. The portions are quite generous and Chris and I always over order, but it makes for a great late night snack while we binge watch B horror movies. 👨‍❤️‍👨💕🍾🥂🍕

Anyone else get reminded of their drunken 20’s every time you order pizza from a walk-up window?It reminds me of a one night stand - very casual and quick, a little trashy cause a lot of alcohol, but not much eye contact, with very little talking and really no exchanging of too much information at all. Just a couple quick slices and we part ways. And then the next day you wake up thinking, ugh...what did I do!? 😒Perhaps this is why I was able to get out of my party phase early on. Because I was eating too much damn pizza. Perhaps I’m reading too much into this, but it’s my pizza so I get to too enjoy it that way I want...with pineapple! And luckily the very friendly guys at @21stcenturypizza window got me covered with their delicious ‘ham+jalapeño+pineapple’ by the slice and a of course a classic pepperoni for good measure. They’ve dubbed their pizza as “chronic in a box” which let’s face it, will always be better than Jack...👍🏾🍕

Of course I’d much rather be at a beach or even a river or just lost somewhere exploring. But If I have to be stuck in this city during its heat wave, then by all means please hide my petty ass in a corner somewhere underneath some shade so that I may recharge. Started my morning off at my favorite neighborhood cafe @clearingcafe which is appropriately hidden down a street lined with lush green trees. Their ‘everything turkey bagel sandwich’ is everything too me and the perfect way to start my long day of figuring out where to find some good air conditioning. Someone once told me that consuming hot beverages like tea or coffee on a hot day actually helps counteract the heat...but I don’t feel it working. Why am I so damn gullible. ☕️🤦‍♂️

Ok listen...I’m not one who typically supports the big chain restaurants or any of the many corporate owned cookie cutter franchise operations. It’s no offense to the people I know who work in them or dine religiously with them, it’s just not my thing. My loyalty is and will always be to the underdogs, the family owned businesses, the chef-owned concepts or even the local chains. That said, Chris and I drove the 25 or so odd minutes from Portland all the way up to the middle of nowhere in back country Ridgefield, WA to finally check out the Michael Jordan’s steakhouse that happens to randomly be located in the year old @ilaniresort casino. Now, I’m very selective on where I get my steak from, so we came solely for dessert. I’ve been hearing these rumors about a life changing mystical 23-layer chocolate cake that they have that is supposed to be so decadent and delicious, which surprisingly happens to be the same adjectives that I use to describe myself, so I had to come taste the chocolate, edible drag version of me! And honey, it did not disappoint 💅🏾This thing is massive! I for sure thought Chris and I could tackle it together but were sadly defeated when we finally caved in and asked for a to-go box. I would definitely be tempted to go back and try more desserts as the service was very friendly specifically from the hostess who was very sweet to us. I don’t know much about basketball or even Michael Jordan for that matter but I do know some good cake when I eat it. I would say it’s worth a stop if you’re driving up I-5 and looking to satisfy your sweet tooth. 🏀🍰🤤

Date night with Chris at the recently opened Peruvian restaurant @casazoraya . This is one of the “Hottest Restaurants in Portland” right now and we were excited to experience it. The food was simply delicious! But let me tell you what I loved about it. What sold me on this restaurant is that it’s family owned and family operated. Chef and owner Zoraya along with her 2 children Gary and Gloria all migrated separately from a small town in the Sacred Valley of Peru called Calca, where they also owned and ran a small restaurant that catered mainly to the locals. Shortly after arriving to Oregon, Zoraya was hired on to Andina, Portland’s famed Peruvian restaurant, as a cook and helped open the property in 2003 remaining one of the OG hires until now. Their roles are clear: Zoraya comes bearing traditional recipes passed down to her from generations of a bloodline that all share the same passion and drive for food and culture, which is then blended in with her son Gary’s modern approach to innovative cuisine from his culinary degree he received back in Peru. This is all executed with warm hospitality and a smile by her daughter Gloria, the sole operator of the dining room: welcoming guests, explaining menu items and serving. “We took a leap of faith” she said to me. “My mom has invested every penny of her savings into this”. I could certainly taste it in each dish...the passion, the hard work, the time, the energy, the family legacy, all of which is on the line. You could visually see it in the concerned faces of Zoraya and Gary which would periodically peek out from the kitchen to survey the reactions of the room that were filled with satisfaction and comfort from the delicious foods. It’s a beautiful team effort nonetheless. A close nit family that is sticking together and planting the seed of their future into the soil of the American Dream and giving us not only a taste but a glimpse of their beautiful and rich culture. Go here! 🙏🏾 .

Just had the most wonderful dinner at my 3rd Michelin Star restaurant, and this time at the amazing Wing Lei in the beautiful @wynnlasvegas hotel. This is hands down the most upscale Chinese restaurant I have ever been too. This is also the first Chinese restaurant to ever be awarded not only the coveted Michelin Star but is also the only Forbes Travel Guide 5-Star Award Wining Chinese restaurant in North America (say that 3 times in a row).............This restaurant is absolutely stunning with lavish golds and jewel tones that make it feel both timeless and opulent. It would be like dining in the Empress of China’s jewelry box, or at the very least, a very rich and dramatic (goes without saying) drag queen. I ordered the Imperial Peking Duck Tasting menu, which was entire half of a duck that had been roasted and was carved table side into my first course. The remainder of the duck would then be taken away from the table back to the chef to prepare the rest of each of my courses to come. This was an amazing meal, and hands down the best duck I have ever eaten. The service were equal parts professional, personal, paced and not pretentious at all. Very well educated team with an eye for detail in every scope of the experience. This was one of those dining experiences when everything just works seamlessly well together, from service, to food to ambiance. It’s the opposite of what you would normally expect from your local go to General Tsao Chicken joint and for good reason. My mentality for legit Chinese restaurants were always “good food but bad service.” And the reason I always go back, is because every once in awhile I’m willing to sacrifice service for great, authentic food. But tonight, I was able to have it all! 🙏🏾

Jumped off the plane, grabbed and Uber and immediately darted over to Momofuku for lunch with my suitcase in tow. I have been thinking about these noodles ever since I watched Chef David Chang’s Netflix series ‘Ugly Delicious’ and then read all about him. At 41, this Korean-American is one of the youngest decorative chefs with multiple James Beard awards, 2 Michelin Stars and a slew of successful restaurants scattered around North America and Australia. This location in the @cosmopolitan_lv just opened up last year and has been making a big name for itself in a city where having your own restaurant as a celebrity chef means you’ve made it. I mean clearly, as he has me flying across state lines to taste his food. 🙏🏾

I think I’m the only person who escapes a heat wave by going to a hotter destination! Since Chris has too work I’m stuck in Portland’s 90+ degree weather with no A/C and nothing to do so I’m heading to Vegas to relax by a pool with something cold in my hand. I’m not a partier or a gambler, but I love to dine out and luckily there are tons of restaurants for me to explore. Brb, heading to Sin City! Stay cool Portland! 🙏🏾😎 (ps, my outfit actually makes sense when you see the whole thing!) 😬

I’m on the hunt to find the best Khao Soi dish in the city. Ever since I had my first experience with this delicious creation in #chiangmai I’m obsessed with eating more of it. Listen, even if I knew how to cook, legit Thai curry is a process and a skillful one to try and create. This is why most westerners just use curry paste, cause they can’t perfect it like our brothers and sisters have in Asia. After taking koko for a hike through Washington Park yesterday, I came down the trail to Burnside towards Westover Rd to make my way home through the less crowded 24th Ave. It was there that I saw it. Hiding in plain sight all along. Waiting for me to discover it, or at least be reminded of it. An actual restaurant called...Khao Soy! And why did they name it Khao Soy? Because they are known for said dish which hails from the northern region of Thailand, like Chiang Mai. It wasn’t until I actually traveled to this specific area of Thailand that I discovered this dish. Sure, this is a popular main stay amongst Thai food lovers and is not something that is uncommon or some sort of hidden menu item. But I personally had never ordered it, let alone heard of it, and must’ve always skipped that part of the menu when in past Thai restaurants. But eating it Chiang Mai and having such a wonderful experience from not only the food, but the people who served it as well is what stayed in my memory, and why I was on a mission to find it here in Portland. And all of a sudden now, I finally walk past a restaurant located up the street from my house, that I knew existed but never bothered to go too, and they just happen to serve this amazing dish which they named their restaurant after...that’s what food is about for me. Opening my eyes to something new but  connecting me back to a wonderful life experience while satisfying my appetite...that’s the beauty of food. 🙏🏾

92-degrees and barely any humidity!? I’ll take it! Its a little more bearable for me compared to the 1000% humidity it was last week while on vacation. That said, I decided to take koko on an urban hike to Washington Park which is our top favorite park in Portland. We stopped off at @foodfrontcoop for some fresh fruit and @sthonorebakery for some delicious, flakey and airy butter croissants for our picnic. By the time we got to the amphitheater and found a nice comfortable spot to relax in, we were toast! That heats a little more intense when your hiking around in it. Luckily for koko, she gets to sit in the shade with fresh cold water and treats while being fanned down by me, as I sweat and look a mess with croissant crumbs stuck to my face. (Yes, that very flamboyant geisha or “gay-sha” fan is for koko, not me)🐶😅👘🍑🍇🥐

I’ve been craving street food ever since I got back from Thailand and it’s all I can think about. I mean, I always think about food, but there is something so special about walking down a foreign street and smelling the fresh aromas of spices and cooked meats being prepared while witnessing the natural engagement of strangers interacting through the language of food. While getting back into my normal routine, I took koko for a morning walk and to drop off my weekly dry cleaning and as I make my way down NW Thurman suddenly the sweet scent of summer begins to fill the air and captures not only my  attention, but Koko’s as well. It’s the smell of barbecue. And that charred, smoky, intoxicating scent is courtesy of Dan, the owner of #westcoastbento and between the hours of 10am until 2:30pm Monday through Friday, you can find Dan outside his small shop grilling up his famous marinated meats while greeting repeat customers and neighbors as they pile in for a taste of his quick and easy, no fuss bento. We’re talking delicious barbecued chicken, beef and lamb skewers on top of a generous serving of your choice of brown or white rice. Although bento is a Japanese concept, and marinated beef and rice remind me of Hawaiian food, what Dan provided for me today was a flashback to the experiences I had with street food in Thailand. Simple, delicious, filling, cheap and warm hospitality. Suddenly, it’s not so bad to be back home. 🙏🏾 🍱 .

What I’ll remember the most from this trip are the lives, both big and small, that helped to inspire me to see my life from a different angle. Many people, and even animals, who have struggled in various situations with the lack of opportunities that we all take for granted. All of a sudden, the small and often “first world problems” that I once thought were struggles, are now merely opportunities for me to become better at appreciating all that I have and teach me to be more humble and grateful. Because if someone with nothing can survive and still be someone with nothing yet still have an open heart with the respect to be compassionate towards others time and again, than that person truly has everything.................................”Travel isn’t always pretty. It isn’t always comfortable. Sometimes it hurts, it even breaks your heart. But that’s okay. The journey changes you; it should change you. It leaves marks on your memory, on your consciousness, on your heart and on your body. You take something with you. Hopefully, you leave something good behind.” Anthony Bourdain 🙏🏾

I was told that once you’ve seen 1 temple, that you’ve pretty much seen them all. That was not the case for me. In fact, every time I saw one I made a point to go in and explore. Each of these temples have so much meaning and history behind them. One of the more famous and notable ones to visit is Wat Arun which known as the “Temple of Dawn”. This is said because the early light of morning sun reflects off of the surface of the temple with pearly iridescence. This temple dates back to the 17th century during the reign of the Ayutthaya Kingdom. I was in complete awe of the ornate hand carved details and porcelain that made up this gorgeous site. You could feel the presence of history here and the local Thai people doing what they can now to help preserve that, so I was surprised to find out that we were allowed to climb the steps to explore certain parts of this sacred place. I ended up going in the late evening as I also heard that the rays of the sun setting will usually cast a beautiful glow to the temple which of course makes for great photos. But as my luck would have it, that was the only time of the day when a brief thunderstorm moved in. Nonetheless, still worth the multiple subway connections and sketchy boat ride over the river to go and see. 🙏🏾

I did a self-guided tour of Bangkok’s China Town and my first impression was, Wow! I felt as if I were actually in China. I was also a little embarrassed and slightly offended because I kept thinking about Portland’s sad little “China Town” which is a 10 or so block radius lined with sleazy clubs and drug addicts and lack anything close to Chinese culture other than the Chinese Gardens. I’m really not surprised that Bangkok would have a genuine representation of Chinese culture however, as a flight from BKK to Hong Kong is less than 3 hours. These alleyways that I explored were jam packed with Chinese owned businesses and vendors who were selling everything from fresh produce, baked goods, to chinese herbs, gadgets and of course, gold! China is one of the leading suppliers of gold and people flock to Bangkok’s China Town in hopes of finding the best deal. It was navigating the busy streets and avenues of China Town that I truly realized, I’m in Asia! The street food here definitely rivals the Thai street food, each staying true to their unique flavors that we all have come to enjoy. 🙏🏾

What I’m doing is allowing the food to drive me. Lead me to a place I otherwise would’ve never known. I’m putting what little faith I have into the hands of the people that practice, celebrate and protect their cultural heritage. I’m allowing their food to help translate their language and in the grand scheme of things, I start to better understand who they are and that hopefully they realize that I am someone who is grateful to be invited to the table. This experience of not only seeing the glamour but being able to peek behind the curtain and witness the actual reality has been humbling and I’m glad that I was able to not just learn more about a corner of the world, but about myself as well. Khorb Khun Na Ka 💕🙏🏾

Just had my second Michelin Star dining experience and this time for lunch at the ever reputable @jaime_bangkok by world renowned chef Jean-Michel Lorain...It was 5-courses, each telling the story of generations through French recipes passed down from his grandmother, to his father, and now to him. I was personally attended too by Marine Lorain, daughter to Chef Lorain, the fourth generation heiress in line to their throne of culinary gold. Her expertise and passion for fine dining was unmatched as she and her team of wonderful seasoned professionals guided me through a mouth watering journey of innovative and exquisite French cuisine. The main course was a winner, Pan Seared Kamui Beef Filet cooked to a perfect medium-rare which I enhanced with shaved black truffles. This must be what heaven tastes like. 🙏🏾

You guys, I’m crushing it with my #bucketlist here in #thailand Came back to #bangkok from #chiangmai and took myself out to my first ever Michelin Star restaurant. The dining experience was insane! A delicious 10-courses, each a modern twist on traditional Thai food. The presentations of each dish were incredible, some being prepared table side. They first lead you to a plush sitting room with lush couches and ornate decor to begin the multiple starter courses, all of them being explained in great detail by the professional team. Once those are completed, you are then led to your table to the gorgeous dining room to for the main course and remainder. The service was insanely detailed. Being addressed by last name with each course to never having too ask for anything at all as it was always provided. As a foodie and someone involved with the hospitality industry, this experience was what I’ve always dreamed of. I feel like I can die happy knowing that I’ve done a good percentage of what’ve I’ve always wanted to do. Also, check out the petit fours course with the live live tree, edible legos, and chocolate red peppers (some edible, some not, it was a fun game from the chef and you had to guess). This was exquisite  world class dining. 🙏🏾

I just completed my volunteer time with @elephantnaturepark in Chiang Mai and I’m so grateful yet upset from hearing the stories of how these gentle giants were rescued and came to this amazing organization, which happens to be THE most ethical elephant sanctuary in Thailand that is doing everything in their power to protect this species. Grateful because I know that they are now in good hands, but upset because of the stories of their past. All of them were abused by the hand of man. Poached from the wild and either forced into logging, circuses, begging on the streets and/or any other form of human entertainment like being rode with a saddle, the list goes on and on about the cruelty that was and still is the reality for these majestic beings. These beautiful, intelligent, emotional animals were beaten and neglected, and all share stories of a sordid past that they now have to live with. They deserve to be in the wild! It is so hard to wrap my brain around how people can have such disregard for the lives of these animals. Their stories all deserve to be told and I am so thankful to have done this project and too have met such amazing inspirational people who are doing what they can to help preserve and conserve this soon to be extinct species. I was able too meet Lek who is the founder and bad ass backbone of this organization. Because elephant poaching in Thailand is such a money maker, Lek which means small in Thai, is a 5 ft. something angel that, on the daily, receives multiple death threats due to her passionate conservation work and beliefs that these animals deserve better. And her mentality about it is too keep educating, and keep talking about the fair and ethical treatment of these animals and too try and rescue all of the abused ones from their sad situations and provide them a glimpse of hope and peace for the remainder of their lives. If you ever find yourself in Southeast Asia look up their projects as they have many in the neighboring countries, and again, are praised with being the MOST ethical sanctuary. Khorb Khun Na Ka 🙏🏾🐘

Who said paradise was only limited to sandy beaches and clear blue waters (although it helps). I would be willing to trade in a day at the worlds most beautiful beach to eat this Khao Soi Curry that I found at a local family owned restaurant hidden off an alley way in Chiang Mai. This is everything in a restaurant that I love...family owned, cheap prices, fresh and local ingredients, and such friendly service. Seriously you guys, my server and the owner of the restaurant help me set this shot up, who does that!? If you’re ever in Chiang Mai and want a delicious authentic Thai experience, check this place out, you’ll be praying to Buddha every night for this! 🙏🏾✊🏾

I’m not a religious person but I do respect and appreciate others who are and the Thai people here predominantly practice Buddhism throughout the country. There are beautiful temples everywhere you look, some dating to periods of time when certain dynasty’s reigned over or some make shift ones in the corner of ones yard or in an alley way created for one to practice and pray, asking for everything from blessings of good fortune and health, to hope. Bowing here is a sign of respect to one another and to Buddha as well. I’ve noticed people making a point to bow towards a temple if they happen to just walk by one. You can feel the sense of respect and peace that the Thai people have here. I wish I could bottle it up and present it to the USA as a birthday gift. I read about the Silver Temple up in Chiang Mai which dates back to the 1500’s and made a point to go seek it out upon arriving. It was worth the long walk in the humid and heat. 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾

Finally!!! After a day and a half of not being able to use my phone (t-mobile fucked up my plan) I’m back online. Spent my first day yesterday shopping, exploring, getting lost and you guessed it...eating. My hotel is close to one of the smaller night markets in Bangkok which is still big in comparison to any of the ones in the states so I popped over to check it out. Now I’m brave when it comes too eating street food and I have no problem diving into some 3 hour old meat on a 90 degree humid day as I have in Mexico, but Thailand is different level, and I can see how people who are not used too eating that way might become a little sick after enjoying the delicious flavors. Luckily, my islander stomach has me covered. Also, that was some pretty solid Pad Thai and meat skewers that I had! 👍🏾🙏🏾 .

My passion and curiosity for food, culture and travel is leading me to Thailand today. I’m so excited to explore a new country, a new culture, and of course delicious food. A little bummed out that Chris isn’t able to make this trip with me due to work, but I’m excited nonetheless. What a perfect time for some self-reflection and to maybe discover something new about myself, cause we can all use a moment to ourselves sometimes to remind us how great life can be. Hopefully, America will have time to do the same. BRB, going to explore! ✈️ .

It’s safe too say that I would much rather #makeitrain at a strip mall over a strip club any day! I ended up right in the middle of suburbia which meant my food options were limited to chain restaurants or fast food, neither of which I’m a fan of. But I’m a sucker for some good Chinese food, and strip mall grub tends to have its own unique sense of experience, some good some bad. Thus leading me too my first time at @cantonphoenix_wilsonville I must say, the food was satisfying and the service ultra friendly. I never have high expectations for random places that I find last minute but this place did the job. If I ever find myself navigating the cookie cutter streets of Wilsonville again, I’d definitely pop back by. 🤙🏾🙏🏾

I was #blessed to be born in Hawaii and given a very beautiful Hawaiian name. But some of the most annoying things that always happen too me is 1) people not being able to pronounce my very easy to pronounce name and 2) people saying “aloha” once they finally do...it’s like, ok #haole 😒 What I do love that brings back memories as a child, on or off the island, is shaved ice. My mom would make her version of it for us during the hotter months and I just remember always looking forward to the many sweet flavors and colors. This was our ice cream. So I was extremely excited when I went to @wailuashaveicepdx downtown. The flavors are definitely more artisan and unique then what my mom would make, but the childhood memories that it brought back were still the same. #mahalo 🙏🏾🍧

I finally got a chance to visit @chapelhillpdx and I was not disappointed. This brand new joint is from the same owner of @churchbarpdx By day, the vibe here is more chill and relaxed with the sun shining down on their sprawling back patio which FYI: is dog friendly. By night, the energy of this dimly lit lounge amps up and transforms into a super hip, energetic “see-and-be-seen” tattooed Portland crowd equipped with local DJ’s spinning everything from Hip Hop to Indie Pop. But because I recognize that I am 1 year away from being in my mid-30’s and too old to party and quite frankly “hang”, I opted for the daytime experience and geared more towards the food. It’s Asian fusion, and I say that respectfully as the owner hails from Hawaii and has more business messing around with this style of cuisine than some of you people out there do. The standout dish for me was the Pad Thai Crunchwrap...you read that right, Pad Thai noodles stuffed with creamy melted cheese, bean sprouts, peanut sauce, in a crunchy tortilla! 🤯 I was shooketh by the first bite! Even better, this place is super accommodating as every item on the menu has a vegan and a gluten-free option to choose from. So yes, vegans can all get a version of that delicious creation. Get here now!!! Also, check out that DJ Booth! 🎧🏳️‍🌈

I think I just found my favorite Thai restaurant downtown...scratch that, I know I just found my favorite Thai restaurant downtown. I’ve passed this place for many years and never thought too eat here due to its random location below PSU and overlooking the freeway. But Chris and I gave it a try last week and it was so good that we came back tonight for dinner. This spot has the best value hands down. There’s a page in the back of the menu that offers family style dining for parties of 2 or more and for $17.50 per person you get a shit ton of food starting with apps, a curry dish, a noodle dish, a stir fry, rice and even dessert!!! And all of this is complimented by fantastic friendly service! It’s such a shame I’m just now getting here, but so glad I decided to give them a try, and now so should you! 👊🏾👍🏾

I’ve always wondered if it were best to eat before you shop so you can see if things truly fit, or try the clothes on and purchase them at your slimmest before you eat and pray that your gut will contract back. I’m in between both of those theories right now at @babasmg cause I wasn’t hungry before shopping and then became starving halfway through. Luckily, their shawarmas are pretty guilt free and healthy like a salad that I don’t feel like I should just say fuck it and start browsing for a muumuu dress. Guess the only thing I have to worry about is that deep fried falafel which I currently have no regrets about. 😬

Sometimes, when my body randomly wakes up at 5am for no reason, I go for a long run and then a decently healthy breakfast and then back home for a nap. Luckily living in the NW district there are some amazing restaurants and cafes that are open early like @clearingcafe which is open at 6:30 am. This family owned bakery and cafe is hidden away from the ever eye-rolling crowds and tourists on 23rd street and has more of a ‘locals only vibe’, but of course graciously serves everyone. They’re also conveniently located right below one of the largest urban parks in our nation should you or a random coyote feel the hunger pains after clearing a 40-mile hike. Do yourself a favor, and order everything I ate in this picture! K bye, nap time! 🏃🍽😴

I’ve always been an advocate for supporting local businesses ever since I got out of the corporate world and started working for a family run operation. So it always brings me great joy to see these small independently operated concepts grow into these strong local businesses that help provide jobs to people in the community as @gueropdx has done. From food truck to brick and mortar, this restaurant has created a cult following and for good reason. They pride themselves on serving the “No. 1 Tortas Since 2013” all made from local ingredients. That said, I ordered the 2nd best thing on their menu, the Cart Bowl. I’m a sucker for meat and rice and just couldn’t resist. Besides, I have had their tortas in the past and for what it’s worth, I can vouch for them being #1 in the city! ☝🏾

🍛: Cart Bowl = ensalada fresca, avocado dressing, esquires, lime rice, pinto beans, cotija cheese, poblano cream, fresh pickled onion, radish, cilantro, lime, chile, sesame w/ 1 topped w/ carnitas and the other with shredded beef and organic egg 👊🏾

I love how cute Clinton street is. It almost feels like you’re in a small town tucked away in the city. We grabbed a late lunch at @dotscafepdx after exploring the hood. I love the vibe of this place as it’s a very mom & pop style diner but with a Portland dive bar feel at the same time and all this is reflective of their menu. It’s comfort food that’s not trying too hard to impress but wanting to satisfy, and that’s exactly what it did. Side note: this place is open late until 2:30 am, so if your ever looking for another late night spot to grub, they got you covered. .

Did you know that Portland is home to the “World’s Smallest Park” as proclaimed by the Guinness Book of World Records. And that this park is a mere 452 square inches located on Naito Pkwy in between 2 heavy lines of traffic. And that I can now say that I have had a delicious picnic in the World’s Smallest Park, thanks to @808grinds @bunksandwiches and #shanghaisbest  I’ve done some pretty odd things in my life, and this is one for the list. Nothing says “Keep Portland Weird” more, then having a picnic in the middle of the street surrounded by traffic in a tiny park. Just doing my part people! 🤓

Just saw the movie #hereditary at  @laurelhursttheater and I’m scared/confused/lost from what I just saw. So we decided to grab a bite to eat 1 block down the street and dissect this movie and since we skipped popcorn during the film we went to @goosepdx and had their corn on the cob instead. You guys, I’m gonna go ahead and say it...this is hands down the best corn that I have ever laid my skanky lips on! Game changer! I can’t describe it, you just need to get here and eat it for yourself! Also, check out that gigantic bomb ass burrito the size of my forearm or a small baby! The goose is loose y’all! 👍🏾

Did you know that @friedegglove is a a pun on The Cure’s song, “Friday I’m in love”!? And if you didn’t every time you pass it now you’ll have no choice but to sing those lyrics!? This place serves up delicious breakfast sandwiches and their names are all music puns, like their signature item appropriately called the Yolko Ono. This place is egg-cellent if you’re looking for a quick breakfast on the go our a chill place to stop for lunch. How egg-citing! 🥚 .

It’s gonna be a beautiful #sunny day in the #cityofroses so I’m out and about getting my city tan on. First stop, brunch at @wafflewindow on Hawthorne. This place is literally a little window which is carved outside of another popular Portland destination that you walk up too, order, wait for your waffle then grab a seat and enjoy. No muss no fuss. Be sure to go at the right time a little after lunch as there can be a pretty long line, but for good reason. 👍🏾

Certain foods to me do more than just satisfying appetites. There are those specific dishes, smells, flavors and ingredients that bring back memories of certain life events or experiences, foods that almost act as a vessel that transports you back in time. To me that’s what the term “food that nourishes the soul” means. It feeds back the memory of you, who you are, your roots. This simple Chicken Pancit Bihon with Lumpia dish that I ordered from Lu’s Teriyaki Bowl & Filipino Food did just that. Each bite brought a memory of my childhood and my mother in the kitchen cooking this same dish and me sitting at the table slurping the noodles down with rice. It was great to share the stories with Chris while we ate and I reminisced. Thank you for the trip down memory lane Chef Lu. 🙏🏾

Now this brings a whole new meaning to waffle cone...ice cream paired with an actual waffle! That’s right...and pair that with bananas, Oreos, chocolate sauce and whipped cream and you’ve found yourself standing in @cartlandia at BT’s Creamery & More. This little food cart is operated by an older Vietnamese husband and wife duo specializing in traditional Vietnamese street food as well as non traditional sweet treats and “more” and is tucked away neatly in the back behind the more glitzy and flashier of the bunch, but definitely deserves a visit! I wasn’t sure I was able to stomach anymore food until I saw a picture of this heavenly concoction plastered on the front of their cart and I knew one way or another that I was going to make it happen, so I did, and I still have no regrets. Allow yourself 10-15 minutes of a wait time after ordering as they make their waffles fresh but this gives you a moment to think about all the times you ordered ice cream that was served in a regular ol’ waffle cone when you could’ve been at BT’s livin’ in the future! 🤖🍦

My love for Korean food didn’t develop until I got older. But I remember going to Korean bbq restaurants with my family when I was younger and not really understanding why my parents always dragged us to these random places to cook our own food. And of course being so young and westernized I was always wanting something more American, like burgers and fries. Looking back at it now, I realize that my parents were not only taking us there cause it was the best value to feed a family, but it was also to be a part of a culture that is quite similar to our island culture in terms of respect, and of course because the food is so damn good! 
We stopped by @piedmontstationfoodcarts and did the usual walk about up and down to see what our appetites were craving. Immediately when I saw Anna Lee’s Korean BBQ, I looked at Chris excitedly and said, “Well, I know what I’m getting!” Miss Anna Lee herself graciously greeted me and proceeded to prepare my order and within moments, I was presented with my Dae Ji Bulgogi (spicy pork). Sure enough, that little snot nosed confused boy in me who always questioned Korean BBQ pushed his burger and fries to the side and grabbed a plate. 🙏🏾 .

Did you know that there are so many theories of how the term “mind your p’s and q’s” became about? One theory was that bartenders in 17th century England would warn patrons to watch their “pints and quarts” if they were becoming too rowdy! To me growing up it was always about minding your manners. But now, it’s a cute little market and restaurant that serves up yummy sammiches, fresh cured meats, fresh veggies, wine and apparently amazing cinnamon rolls! Our appetites stumbled upon this quaint neighborhood gem while searching for some lunch fare after playing fetch with Koko...or, Koko playing fetch with us! 🐶

I sure don’t miss living in the suburbs as I’m a city boy all the way! But after spending a beautiful sunny day with Koko at the beach, our appetites drew us all the way out to @cartlandia which an oasis of food carts located after dozens of strip malls and used car lots far out on East 82nd. I’ll go anywhere that has good food and this place did not disappoint. Decided to get a little bit of everything from steamed pork buns, Mongolian beef and broccoli beef at #bamboocafe and a chicken shawarma at #bombgyro . I now have a reason to come out to the #burbs and now, so do you! 👍🏾

Not a fan of 10 am doctor appointments, but I am a fan of hearing that I have a clean bill of health, so celebratory breakfast desserts @milkglassmrkt it is! I love this little cafe/market tucked away in North Portland. Locally owned and all female driven, this place serves up delicious brunch offerings along with house made sweets, treats and pastries. Also, the street it sits on is N. Gay Ave, so there’s that too! Happy #pridemonth 🌈

Happy #saturday to me (aka your Monday). We’re spending our weekend with Koko and couldn’t think of a better place to take her to #brunch then @tinshedgardencafe This place is essentially considered human friendly as the main clientele base is predominantly 4-legged and furry 🐶. Food here is wonderful and the service is great especially with how accommodating and dog friendly they are. Immediately upon seating, they bring both you and your pooch waters as well as menus for humans and dogs! Koko gives 2 paws 🐾 up for her delicious grilled chicken and sweet potato brunch bowl. .

Coffee, cocoa, cookies...and live music. Chris and I stopped by @hostelcafepdx for an after dinner snack and to catch some live local tunes before heading home last night. I love that this place is open to local explorers as well as international ones as this is the home base for their 5 hostels that surround the cafe under the tree lined canopy of the NW District. A great place to meet friends and make new ones from around the globe, they also feature an entire beer and cider list that is compromised of local craft brews that any beer snob would appreciate. Check them out on Saturday night’s where they host a communal pasta dinner that brings together the local community and beyond. 🤝

I take pride in dining and supporting local businesses, but sometimes I make an exception when ice cream is involved. My go too place is @benandjerrysuptown which is tucked away in the uptown shopping area. I came for a #sugarhigh and boy did they deliver! This gooey-ooey brownie sundae was so delicious that a gentleman walking past me stopped to ask what it was, and came back out of the store with an identical one and then thanked me! No, thank you sir, for realizing that you don’t have to wait in line for 20 minutes to eat overpriced ice cream. 🤫😂🍦

I finally invested into my very first professional camera! It’s the perfect DSLR for a beginner like myself. Hopefully I’ll be able to capture some amazing #food shots and other great stuff on my travels to share with all of you. Thank you to Mike at #shutterbug downtown with helping me find the right brand and model to fit my needs! I also upgraded to a new iPhone and wanted to try both cameras side by side, so we stopped by @pearlthaicafe to eat of course, and take some pictures using both. Here’s a decent shot taken from the iPhone. Stay tuned for more to come! 😊

Garden Monsters just opened a brick and mortar location in the Hollywood District and since bikini season is just days away, I’m here for it!

Vegan, Paleo or Omnivore, this place can accommodate. 🙏🏾👙 .

Not sure what took me so long to finally get around to checking out @duckhousepdx but I wish I would’ve gone earlier cause this is totally my jam. Came here during the week thinking it would be slow, I was wrong. If you’ve ever wanted to see the social dichotomy that makes Portland unique, this would be a place to go. Located downtown by PSU and in the shadow of Portland’s every growing skyline, this unassuming gem caters to everyone from hipsters and college co-ed’s looking for a cheap fix to cure their PBR and THC fueled hangovers, to white collar professionals slopping down noodles while plotting higher rent rates, to me taking pictures of my food and casually judging everyone from the corner booth. Be sure to order the Xiao Long Bao! People die of old age in line waiting for this! Chow Mein is Chow Mein and you can get it anywhere and Beef Rolls were satisfyingly good. 👍🏾

Aaroz con Pollo literally translates to chicken and rice, which is my ultimate favorite food. Well, any kind of meat and rice. One of the best versions of this that I have found is located at @pambiche and is one of the few Cuban eateries in Portland. This family owned Old Havana gem has been dishing out Cuban comfort food for over 17 years and offers a bright, high energy environment with fresh authentic flavors and yuuuge portions! #embargolifted .

🍲: Aaroz con Pollo: Valencia saffron rice and creole chicken cooked with Spanish saffron, smoked paprika, manzanilla olives, fresh herbs and olive sofrito with green peas, cabbage salad and ripe plantains 👊🏾
🍲: Ropa Vieja = Adobo shredded beef laden with yellow onions and green peppers, stewed in herb tomato broth with green peas, garlic crustini and congri. 👊🏾

Had a healthy and delicious breakfast at @thedailyfeastpdx after a long run. Besides being locally owned and operated, what I really love about this place is that it’s driven by some bad ass women! From the cooks, to the servers to the owner Christine Burmeister greeting you at the door and checking in on you table side. This little gem is hidden in plain sight in the heart of downtown Portland, pumping that heart with delicious breakfast and lunch eats daily. 💜❤️🧡💛💚💙✊🏾

Happy #rednoseday everyone! Doing my small part to help raise awareness for child poverty. I’m so blessed and thankful to have been provided the basic necessities growing up like clothes, a bed, and food. Sadly, not every child is afforded that. Children shouldn’t have to go hungry or wonder when the next meal will come. I hope all my fellow #foodies and friends get out there and support the cause. Just a silly red nose can make a huge difference! ✊🏾🙏🏾

Obligatory gym selfie...because it’s been awhile since I’ve been #douchey Being a self-proclaimed foodie has its perks, like the ability to eat whatever, wherever, whenever. Sometimes I don’t make the best eating choices and sometimes I do. But making overall healthy and positive decisions like running, exercising, rarely ever drinking or putting additional toxins in my body is what allows me to feel guilt free for, let’s say, a whole week of eating pizza! 🍕 😬

I knew Portland had a pretty decent slew of Thai restaurants, but I never realized how many of them were actually lined along the streets of the Alberta Arts District alone. With so many choices, it was hard to decide on where to go. Chris and I walked by @tonsaipdx and looked at the menu several times only to go back and forth. What initially drew us was the Grand Opening sign that hung above as they just recently opened and we love supporting new and local businesses. And what will now keep us coming back is their fresh and delicious food paired with warm service. 🙏🏾

This 80+ degree weather got us fleeing the city for a relaxing sun and sand soaked day on the island. We always pass #subking on our way too and from the beach and have always vowed one day to grab sandwiches from them, and today was that day! This family owned and operated joint in the industrial district serves up traditional sandwiches of all kinds, but being the ethnic boy that I am, I couldn’t resist their #bulgogi beef sub!👌🏾

Let’s brunch about it! Since Monday’s are technically Saturday’s for me, I figure I shouldn’t deny myself the opportunity to have brunch on what is considered my weekend. Thank goddess for the amazing @backtoedenbakery which is a plant based cafe/bakery/ice creamery that serves delicious brunch delights 7 days a week. Would an omnivore like myself that also dabbles as an herbivore every once in awhile be consider a foodi-whore? 🤷🏽‍♂️

🍳: Tofu Scramble = house made tofu egg, kale, leek, smokey tempeh, potatoes, and biscuit with jam and butter.

Just a quick snack from my neighborhood coffee spot @commissarycafe which also serves brunch on the weekends. I really just needed an excuse to say that I spent at least 10 minutes of my day outside enjoying the warm weather before I had to go back inside for work. Happy Sunday everyone, aka my Friday! 😊🍪☕️

Fro yo information, I did not whip together this messy yet tasty concoction. This would be the result of me giving Chris $10 and telling him to go inside @yochoicepdx , a self-serve frozen yogurt shop, and get us something refreshing while I wait outside with 🐶. It’s clear to me that 1) Chris doesn’t know the difference between nerds and chocolate sprinkles, and 2) Koko needs a haircut. 🤦🏽‍♂️

Who doesn’t love a good picnic?There’s something about laying out in a park on a warm day with good friends and good food that feels incredibly authentic and romantic at the same time. The beauty about picnics is that you can bring whatever you want and share and enjoy in one another’s company. Also, it seems socially acceptable to drink wine in a public park in Portland so long as you’re having a picnic 🤷🏽‍♂️Thanks to my friends @beaumontmarket a locally owned and operated market that had everything I needed for my impromptu lunch in the park. .

Mmmm, Chicken and rice! How can something so simple be so nice. I never understood why people ate their wings with celery and ranch!? In our house growing up everything was paired with rice, especially the wings, cause not only did it fill you up but it also soaks up all the yummy sauce! That’s what I love about @whiteelephantpdx which gave me the option of adding rice to these bomb ass wings! But Don’t tell #bbqbecky how we roll, we don’t need no drama! 😂

Ya’ll I think I’m becoming #vegan ! Just kidding...sadly, I don’t think I have that much will power. But for some reason I’ve been craving Vegan food lately, and I know not all of it is healthy but I was proud of myself for going that direction with one of @thenativebowl delicious salads.  I love that their imitation Chik’n is not only spelled like that but it also tastes like real chicken! 🍗 .

Had an amazing time hanging out with old friends last night. I’m not a huge drinker so after a couple of cocktails topped off with champagne, I’m feeling the effects of being #lit (is that what the kids say?) The only thing on my mind today was @annabannanascafe steamed eggs! Fun fact: this locally owned and operated coffee shop is Portland’s first and oldest which helped usher in the thriving coffee culture we now see in Portland. #respect .

Are you guys excited for the hot weather we have this weekend and beginning of next week!? I’m trying my best to make healthy food choices so that I can be ready for bikini season which is right around the corner. Speaking of around the corner, thank you to my friends and neighbors @moberipdx for my açaí bowl today which has become my go to for breakfast/lunch/dinner and snack! I’ll be in a 2-piece bikini in no time! 👙🏖💪🏾

How could I possibly have forgotten the Kimbap my favorite Korean dish from @bibi2go_pdx ! I’m not a seafood fan at all, which is pretty sacrilegious as an islander (sorry fam), so I never understood the hype about sushi. But beef Kimbap is like food for my soul. I get as excited rollin’ this up as @snoopdogg probably gets rollin’ up a blunt. #thuglife😎 .

I’ve always been a huge fan of rice bowls ever since I was a kid. My mom would always make me things like scrambled eggs with rice, or chicken and rice, or beef and rice all mixed up and served neatly in a bowl. As an adult now, it’s still one of my favorite go to dishes and today there are so many variations to choose from with a lot of healthy options too. My current favorite are the ones from @byeandbyeportland which are all made vegetarian. The owners of this bar are the brilliant minds behind a slew of different iconic Portland bars who I feel don’t necessarily get the recognition for their food as they do their hip concepts and tasty cocktails. 👋🏽 and 👋🏽 .

🍲: Southwest Bowl = Nutritional yeast tofu, brown rice, red beans, collard greens w/ chipotle ranch sauce. (my favorite bowl 😍)

My favorite park in Portland has to be Washington Park. I love hiking and exploring this massive green oasis with it’s extended areas and resting for a picnic in the scenic amphitheater. Today on my way up, I popped into @bibi2go_pdx which is hands down my all time favorite Korean fast food spot in the city. I usually go for the more traditional dishes, but since this was for a picnic I decided to get their Dae Ji Bulgogi Burrito which is spicy pork. Another amazing family owned and operated gem that doesn’t get nearly as much attention as it should. 🙏🏾 🌯

Guess who fought a battle against a box of doughnuts and won!? Sure I burned off a ton of calories in my race yesterday and can probably allow myself to go a little cray cray with the carbs, but I’m testing my will power. My body’s like, “Bitch, you made us run that long ass race and this is what we get!?” Fortunately for me, @harlowportland has some pretty tasty healthy foods, and if I squint my eyes really small, I can pretend like I’m eating a glazed donut. It’s all about them mind tricks! And that’s my healthy beauty tip for you today! 🧙🏽‍♂️ 😑

First half marathon completed! There’s something so special about runners and the respect and  sportsmanship they have for one another. I’ve never been so encouraged and motivated by so many strangers to keep moving and cross the finish line...it’s a wonderful feeling that is quite hard to describe. Of course, having a great team of people to run with only enhances that. “Run when you can, walk if you have to, crawl if you must; just never give up.” #deankarnazes 🏃🏾‍♂️

Just casually having traditional Turkish tea in a bright red double decker bus...I’ve always walked or driven passed @tovcoffeebar but never had the time to check them out, and now I finally have. The Turkish tea was delicious and such an awesome presentation. The bus itself is pretty unique and during the summer or supper nice days, they take the tarp off of the top for an open air concept. Always happy to help contribute to keeping Portland weird!

Have you tried the jam @jamonhawthorne ? Did you know that this delicious concoction is available for purchase and that all those proceeds are donated to a local non-profit? And the current one they are supporting is @thepixieproject which is my favorite one cause it’s a non-profit animal adoption and rescue center that offers a slew of services like: low cost veterinary services for low-income and homeless, free spay and neuter, as well as pet owner education. You know I bought me some jam! This is local supporting local and this is why I love to support local! 🐶🙋🏽‍♂️🙏🏾

Happy #tacotuesday friends! Or as I call it, Taco Choose-Day where I pick a new taco spot to try! I don’t feel too guilty eating these cause it’s much healthier than what I was originally craving, which was Italian food. Also, I feel like tacos are just a filler to satisfy you in between actual meals, so don’t judge me! Also, this was my first time to @stellatacopdx and I gotta say it won’t be my last! .

It’s race week...and in preparing for a race I typically try to make healthier choices as I’m running everyday in anticipation of the big event. And after today’s run, the only thing on my mind was the Japanese Breakfast Bowl from @rootwholebody and a big cup of tea. This place does have a pretty sweet relaxing tea room where you can sit back in a calming space and just be, however, it ended up being a decent day in Portland to actually sit outside. 🙏🏾

I’m gonna go ahead and say that @chickenandguns is probably the best looking food cart that I’ve seen in Portland, and the only one I’ve seen with a legit countertop seating. The chicken here is wood fired which gives it a crisp and smokey flavor yet remains juicy and moist on the inside and paired with crispy potatoes which is what they call “guns”. Couple that with some cold beers and an open fire pit, and that’s date night Portland style! .

I don’t think I’ve ever seen cupcakes cuter than these ones from @toadstoolcupcakes They’re unlike anything I’ve ever tried before from their unique flavors like hot chili chocolate, key lime pie and mango smoothie (just to name a few) to the classics like Boston cream and red velvet. Forget your typical butter cream topped cupcakes, these mini delights have a moist cake in the middle with a creamy topping covered in chocolate ganache! These are probably the best cupcakes I’ve ever tried! 😋

Well, technically it’s always rosé weather but did you know that @cheeseandcrack offers Frozé, which is a frozen rosé wine slushie!?

I’m not  a fan of morning meetings, especially when they are held on my day off and on a gorgeous day. But I am a fan of @cherylson12th Portuguese Sausage Fried Rice for breakfast! Yes I said fried rice for breakfast! This is one of their most popular items that is offered all day. This brings me back to the days when I was just a kid and my mom was chasing me around the house to get me to sit down and eat. Who knew one day I’d be taking pictures of the same dish I avoided! 🤷🏽‍♂️ #sorrymom .

I’ve been craving a good burger lately but I haven’t been allowing myself to have one for fear of completely losing control of my diet. But then I remembered reading about @nextlevelburger and how all of their ingredients are plant based, from the patties to the sauces to their famous shakes, and so I allowed myself to relapse. These burgers taste so greasy and juicy like the real thing, that I thought I was eating actual meat (which I do cause I’m not veg or vegan) but was eating very healthily. Think of it this way: if In-N-Out moved to Portland from California (cause no one from Cali ever moves here) met Burgerville and then had a love child, that hippie child would be Next Level Burger! Yup, I took it to the #nextlevel 👊🏽

It’s officially patio weather season in Portland and every restaurant has opened their outdoor dining areas for your eating and drinking pleasure. I live for gorgeous days like this! But don’t forget, it’s also picnic in a pretty Portland park weather and this green city is filled with amazing parks. I did an urban hike from my place in NW all the way across the river to Mt. Tabor park and stopped at @newseasonsmarket on Hawthorne for my provisions. It’s just so beautiful to see this city from another angle. Get outdoors everyone! .

Good morning Portland and beyond! It’s going to be an insanely gorgeous day today so I got up extra early to fit in a long run so that I can focus on relaxing and exploring this beautiful city. I’m starting my morning out with breakfast donuts from @noladoughnuts which just opened their 2nd and only other location right in the Pearl district. Now I’m certainly not a snob when it comes to donuts, but I am picky on where I spend my money, and this morning I can safely say I made a deliciously wise choice. .

If you’re ever forced with a tough decision to make, as life tends to hand us challenges, always know that I once ordered food from 4 different restaurants because I couldn’t decide on what to get. Pretty much my life advice to you is, order everything! 🤷🏽‍♂️ @pinestreetmarketpdx .

2 more days of #pizzaweek left! If you haven’t gotten out there, then go! I mean, 1 year from now what are you going to tell your kids and your grandkids and their kids what you were doing during pizza week? This is history people! Get on the delicious side of history. Or the crust side, I guess...depending on how you eat your pizza. ✊🏾

If you know anything about the Portland food scene then chances are you’ve purposely waited in line to dine at one of Chef John Gorham’s many unique and iconic restaurants. Here’s a chef that is constantly raising the bar on global cuisine all the while maintaining a signature sense of Portland. Fortunately for me, I didn’t have to wait in line to dine at the west side location of @shalomyallpdx This intimate restaurant serves up Israeli style street food with fresh local ingredients paired with warm and knowledgeable service, that I gladly would’ve waited in line for. Shalom Ya’ll ✌🏽

🥗: Fennel Salad = candied pecans, tarragon, grilled lemon vinaigrette 🍛: Labneh & Grilled Pita = fried cauliflower, za’atar .

Afternoon delight. Loving this Portland weather and it’s only going to get better from here! Popped into @lovejoybakers a local bakery and coffee shop with a location in the Pearl for a quick snack break on my afternoon jog. Nothing like a chocolate chai latte and chocolate meringue swirl to pack on the calories I just burnt off. .

I’m currently in between pizzas so I took a lunch break at @bstreetcoffee today. This cute little coffee shop is a “blink and you’ll miss it” little gem hidden in plain sight right off West Burnside. I had a random craving for waffles in the afternoon and remembered over hearing in a conversation sometime ago about the waffles here. See, it pays to eavesdrop! Also, check out their awesome tables that are designed/created by @hammerandvine plant shop which is their next door neighbor! .

🍽: Tropical Waffle = coconut waffle, strawberries, chocolate sauce, hazelnut sauce, and shredded coconut 👊🏽
🍵: Matcha Latte .

Happy 3rd Day of #pizzaweek friends! My belly and I are having a blast checking out and discovering new spots around the city, and one of our faves so far is @the_1905 This speak easy-esque joint is hidden off the main strip of Mississippi Ave. and is a hip spot for craft cocktails, live jazz music and of course, pizza! .
.

🍕: Sweater Weather = cream sauce, mozzarella, pecorino, roasted butternut squash, brown sugar, sautéed mushrooms, red onions, sage, chili oil. 👊🏽

Where all my gluten-free 
and/or vegan friends at!? I got a spot you’re gonna love! @petuniaspiesandpastries located downtown specializes in delicious gluten free and vegan baked pastries and pies. I’m neither vegan nor gluten intolerant, but I can tolerate some delicious cake and house made hot chocolate anytime! FYI: this place also serves savory lunch fare like sandwiches and salads, should you need a first course before your sweets! .

Oh girl, did you think my fat ass was done eating some pizza!? No no hunty, this is #pizzaweek we still got 5 more days to go! I just happened to be in the Mississippi hood and walked by @mississippipizzapub and saw that they were participating an popped in. This place gets extra bonus points cause they are connected to #atlantislounge which hosts free live music, so my ‘food dance’ was to actual music! .

Did you really think that I forgot about @portlandmercury pizza week!? Today was the first day of the week long celebration where participating Portland restaurants are offering slices of pizza for only $2! I popped into @sizzlepie for a cut of their popular vegan Maps Out of Hell, which is creamy basil cashew spread, seasoned soy curls, tomato, black olives and pepperoncinis. 👊🏽

London Bridge has fallen down and is now a restaurant.  Have you checked out @kingsland_kitchen yet? This is another food cart turned brick and mortar success story with the food being British pub fair in a bright, hip and stylish atmosphere in the guise of a rapidly changing downtown Portland. Yes, they do have the traditional English breakfast but since my appetite was being picky with me today, I opted for the avocado toast which is all around satisfying and delicious. .

I thought I was absolutely fine with regular ol’ fried chicken until I tried Thai fried chicken at @hatyaipdx and now I’m hooked! The flavors paired with the stickiness and crunch is so unique. I’ve always eaten my fried chicken with rice (islander thing) but pairing it with curry and roti bread is genius and so not what I expected but so what I was looking for all along. 🍗 .

Date day!!! Chris took me to @omsi for my first time and we had a blast checking out all the exhibits. All that science built our appetite up and we decided to try something new. We stopped by @jurassiccart (me) Venezuelan food from @laarepapdx (chris) for some delishish grub. Do yourself a favor and order The Triceratops Box w/ Teriyaki Skewer, Dinosaur Egg, Chipotle Mashed Potatoes and Cauliflower Rice...so freakin’ good! Also, each order comes with a lil’ dinosaur 🦖 .

I love trying new places in my neighborhood and this morning we did breakfast at #nancyskitchen off of NW Thurman. This restaurant may be fairly new, but Nancy herself has been cooking, creating and contributing to Portland’s food scene for over 30 years. She was all smiles while cooking our delicious Country and Garden Skillets with a Belgian waffle on the side. I love supporting small locally owned businesses and it doesn’t get any better than the owner/chef herself preparing your most important meal of the day. .

Did you know that on Monday nights @kensartisan bakery on NW 21st does pizza night? And that the reason why they have their devoted pizza shop in SE is because pizza night at the bakery got so popular and would cause long lines and sell out, that they had to open another location just to focus on pizza, which has won countless awards. This is one of my favorite bakeries in the neighborhood and hands down my favorite pizza spot. Now I just gotta wait 7 more days. 😋🤗 .
🍕= Fennel Sausage @ $13 (serves 1-2) .

Did you know that Salade Niçoise is the topic of many disagreements between traditionalists and innovators in regards to its ingredients? The traditionalists believe that the salad should only consist of 5 specific ingredients and barring any cooked vegetables while the innovators believe that the salad can consist of both traditional elements as well as modern style ingredients. #foodimitatinglife .

I too brunch on Sundays. I just prefer to do it at 1:30 in the morning long before the crowds start lining up outside. If you live in Portland you know about #steppingstonecafe which is an institution hidden in the NW District (my hood) that dishes out hearty American diner style food, with cheap prices, in an unapologetic setting which I love. My mood usually determines what I get, and I ordered the home made Banana Nut Bread French Toast...guess I was feelin sassy. 🍌 💁🏽‍♂️

I cannot Belize that I am just now discovering @lovebelizean an amazing Belizean restaurant located downtown. This family owned and operated restaurant began as a food cart and with quick success, opened a brick and mortar located below PSU. The food is Belizean comfort food, and on this rainy day, nothing comforted me more. This is everything similar to what my mom made for us growing up, with tender marinated barbecued chicken, marinated tri-tip, rice and greens with lots of spice (on the side). Amazing flavors, big portions, and low prices supporting a local family. This is what food is about!

Dim Sum-body say food!? Ok, so technically @bokebowl which I jokingly refer too as Woke Bowl ✊🏽 only offers dim sum service on the weekends. But my weekend is the weekdays and so I created my own. Their fried chicken is a must try, and of course their buns 😍 which I had pork belly, fried chicken, and brisket, all my girls came out for lunch! 🍱

I’ve lived in Portland for going on 8 years now and today I finally made it the @portlandartmuseum .  All firsts constitute a celebration, so I did just that with donuts at @sesameonpark a 30 year old family owned business with a location in the Park Blocks right by the museum. Cheap, big and delicious just like me. 🍩 Also, I know I’m late to the game and Cronuts are so 2013, but I had one for the first time today, which means yet another celebration is in order! 🙃

Here’s an egg-citing way of reusing all those left over eggs from Easter, turn it into an egg-stremely good dish that everyone will enjoy. I’m so egg-static on how egg-stravagant the colors and textures turned out on this cobb-damn salad. So delicious and healthy, one doesn’t feel the need to egg-cercise after. 😎

Popped in to @hi_lo_hotel and had a mocktail at @lo_bar_pdx which is becoming a new favorite go-to spot for me to meet up with friends before or after dinner, as they are situated right near everything downtown. I love the clean warm colors with the interior and the hustle and bustle of the city on the exterior. Definitely on my list of places for my next ‘stay-cation’.

Got me some amazing soap from @maaklab in downtown to clean my dirty hands from all the finger lickin’ good foods I’ve been eating. I found out that this place not only can customize and create your own personal scented products, but they currently do it for a slew of my favorite restaurants and hotels in the Portland area. Being clean never felt so hip! .

I love the concept of dinning halls and @pinestreetmarketpdx in downtown has food to satisfy any palette. On this visit, I attempted to eat healthy with @kurepdx juice bar’s Lady of the Day smoothie and their Mission hot bowl. As you can see, the chubby devil on my left shoulder got to me, and I ended up getting 2 delicious slices of pizza from @checkerboardpizza and a pork bun from @kimjongsmokehouse.pdx all of which, I have no regrets!! 🍲🥤🍕🍘

Nothing warms me up more on these unusually cold spring days than #franksnoodlehouse noodles. Known for their traditional LaMian style noodles which are hand stretched and folded, a technique dating back to the 1800’s, this little family operated restaurant at the base of the Lloyd District made a name for themselves after winning countless awards and even being featured on the #foodnetwork On this visit, Frank himself even took our order. 🍜

Dinner last night: Am I the last person in Portland to finally try @tuskpdx This space is gorgeous and it’s clear that they do aesthetics very well. The focus seem to be towards a modern take on Mediterranean cuisine rather than authentic also offering yet another “craft cocktail” bar experience which Portland seems to find no shortage of. It’s the hipster equivalent to fine dining where tailored suits and hemmed dress have been swapped out for flannel and skinny jeans. Dishes that stood out: Little Gems Salad, Half & Half Hummus and Crispy Bread. Everything was just, ok. Perhaps brunch is the bigger star here as I’ve been told multiple times to check out instead.

Waking up at 7 am to run 9 miles in 30 degree weather is not exactly on my list of favorite things to do.

Hands down the best Thai food I've ever had! @thaifarmhousepdx is a Michelin recognized restaurant that hails from San Francisco's Mission District and they have already made a name for themselves here in Portland's Hawthorne District. For the main course, try their Hat Yai Fried Chicken and the Panang Neua which is a slow braised Bone-in-Short Rib. The colors, flavors, and textures were amazing and the portions huge! In a city already saturated with Thai cuisine, Farmhouse Kitchen Thai stays true to authenticity.🇹🇭 #farmhousekitchenthai #thaifood #michelinrestaurant #pdxfoodie #pdxeats #foodie #yummy #authenticthaifood
Although the Mangonadas that Chris and I had in Mexico were great, this one from @zerodegreesco Is hands down my favorite so far! Sweet, spicy, salty and refreshing! Chris got their Split Cup of Cucumber Lime and Strawberry Limeade with Boba in each. This place was packed and we waited for a bit, but it was well worth the wait. We will definitely be going back to check out more of the menu. 🍓🍹 #zerodegrees #zerodegreespdx #mangonada #mangos #strawberryblonde #pdxdrinks #pdxfoodie #refreshing

To the right...behind the DJ booth. Behind the flowing white curtain stands a door. And behind that door lies a cellar...filled with wine you couldn't even imagine existed.

Somehow, Mexico has accidentally become a 2nd home for me. I have been there 6 times in the past 2 years and every time I go, I learn something new about myself, and something more about the people. We all have dreams and aspirations to live a life filled with love and opportunities not just for ourselves, but for our families and friends too. At birth, we don't get to choose our skin color, our socioeconomic status, our families or what country we are born in. Some people are given a head start, some people have to run extra miles. It's what we make of ourselves and allow others the opportunity to make something of themselves as well. Allow them to live their dreams. I have dreams, and I stand with all the dreamers!

One of the best parts of this trip was being able to be up close with the different species of Sea Turtles 🐢 at Tortungranja which is a turtle farm on Isla Mujeres. After researching the facility, Chris and I made a point to come here so that we could help donate to this amazing sanctuary that's mission is to solely protect and preserve these endangered animals by providing a safe habitat for them to lay and hatch their eggs, as well as rehabilitate injured turtles. Their life cycle from hatched egg to adulthood is just so fascinatingly beautiful and we were so excited to hear and see the conservation efforts that this sanctuary was doing for them. 🐢💚

From dinner the other night. We decided to walk further out into the quiet neighborhoods in hopes of finding delicious food far away from all of the tourism and in an area where the locals go to unwind. We stumbled upon a local Argentinian steakhouse and saw a sign that read "Meat for 2 for $450 pesos". This place was ran by 3 brothers, the younger one grilling and the other 2 serving. They were happy to have us in and we were happy to pay $26 for a meaty feast for 2!

I'm trying to find the correct words to describe the feeling that I felt when i arrived at Chichen Itza, one of the "7 Wonders of the World". It is indescribable honestly, to see these massive ruins and hear the stories of the ancient Mayan people. How all of this, their existence was created and maintained without modern technology. It felt almost insulting to the sacred grounds for me to be there capturing images with my phone and go pro camera. What an awe inspiring moment and check off the bucket list.

Coco Frio in Spanish literally translates too: "Life is too stressful for you to be so concerned all the time, here, take this fresh coconut and go lay out by the beach and chill about it". #islamujeres #cocofrio #mexico #travel #thatbeachlife
Stumbled upon a hole in the wall chicken joint while exploring Isla Mujeres today. Family owned, and they were all there working. Mom greeting and cashiering, son waiting tables and bussing, and dad grilling. It was hands down one of the best barbecued chickens I've ever had, and reminded me of my moms cooking. The family was so nice and welcoming and made us feel at home.

Food doesn't have to be five star cuisine for it to do it's job of satisfying you. Sometimes throwing a couple random pieces of meat between 2 slices of bread is all you need... just don't forget the cheese! How does the saying go?

I'm just so in awe of this place. Such a beautiful concept of a property and eco-friendly as well. Honestly, you have to dine here! @kintohtulum is the restaurant which is located on their resort property @azuliktulum located in the jungle and right on the beach. It's just a magical place!

Wow! What an amazing birthday dinner. Chris and I have been fortunate to dine at many wonderful restaurants, but this one has to be our favorite so far. From the amazing Haute Cuisine, the service, to the incredible views and ambiance. This restaurant is located in the jungle, perched high above the canopy of trees and wildlife. We had an amazing view of the sunset and the ocean. Anytime you go to Tulum, be sure to check out @kintohtulum restaurant. It will change your world!

I read about these bracelets online. Each bracelet is made by employing and empowering women from the State of Yucatán, Mexico who have very limited access to job opportunities. Every bracelet sold directly contributes to improving their quality of life. So I flew down to Tulum, Mexico to get me one! That and a good tan. @colorsxgood

Last nights dinner @hanoakpdx was as delicious as it was adventurous. I ordered the 11-course tasting menu and it was an amazing display of presentation and flavor of Chef Peter Cho's traditional Korean background with a modern take. I can see why Oregonian named them "2017 Restaurant of the Year" and ranked number 8 of "Best New Restaurants" by Esquire and one of the "Best New Restaurants in America" by GQ.

Day 3 of battling this fever/flu bug that snuck up on me and the rest of the world. Chris literally went to 4 different grocery stores and 2 different restaurants last night while I was sleeping to get provisions and all of my favorite foods (and candy ☺️) to nurse me back to health, and that was after taking the day off to take me to urgent care. How am I so lucky to have this man in my life! 👬❤️

These water color paintings are created by the local high school students in the small village of Yelapa (45 min boat ride from PV). The teacher who was selling the art explained to me that all of the money goes directly to the student who created the specific pieces. I purchased a piece that was made from a student named Camilla. Last year she was able to make enough money from her art work to buy a laptop and is now hoping to earn enough money to go to University. I was so proud that the teacher showed me pictures of Camilla and told me her story. I wish Camilla much success to her beautiful future. #camilla #yelapa #supportinglocal #newbeginnings #womenwillchangetheworld

Right now, Canada is in Marijuana limbo as they wait until July for their government to regulate and tax the sale of marijuana. So currently, there are legal dispensaries but also rows of booths downtown selling Marijuana to the public as seen here. #vancouverbc #canadasgonegreen
Another Birthday dinner, and tonight at Chef David Hawksworth's restaurant Hawsworth. It was one of the best fine dining experiences we've had. Each course a delicate balance of flavor and texture. The service was top notch from everyone. When you come to BC, do yourself a favor, get dressed up and wine and dine yourself at Hawksworth. #hawksworth #vancouverbc

Got a chance to visit the famous Stanley Park and see the Totem Poles today. This city is beautifully rich in culture, vibrancy and art. #stanleypark #seawall #totempoles #vancouverbc
Just had one of the best dinners, with the most attention to detail service at one of Vancouver BC's top restaurants. Thank you to our server Mike who went above and beyond to make it a memorable experience for Chris and I. If you are ever up here in BC, be sure to stop by this place and request Mike.
Just landed, and immediately had to see what all the fuss about Tim Horton's is about. #canada #vancouverbc #timhortons #timmys
Surprise, Surprise!!! Chris was excited to finally find out what where I'm actually dragging him too for dinner. I think I was more excited to see his reaction, especially because I think he thought we were going to Mexico. Brb, going to see if we can spot Justin Trudeau!
Saturday 11/11 was Chris's birthday, but we couldn't celebrate cause I had to work, and when I asked him what he wanted to do the week after to celebrate, he told me he just wanted a nice dinner. So I said, ok, I'll take you to a nice dinner, grab your passport. Surprising him with dinners this week in a different country. He still doesn't know where, and if you know, don't tell him! ☺️

I had the chance to get together with friends to today to go and visit our friend Doug Lindstrom who is not doing so well. Sundays were my tradition to go see Doug. Tonight, although he was not there pouring my usual PBR and Jaeger shot, I went and ordered one. Cheers to you Doug Lindstrom! Thank you for your heart! I look forward to sharing more stories with you, wherever and whenever we see each other next.

Excited for this show! This will be my 5th Cirque Show in a row. #kurios #cirquedusogay
Someone build a ark, and put 2 of me on it!
Can't sleep, and I needed some sort of  #moment to gear me back up for Mexico, so I walked across the street to visit my favorite bartender Andrew at @matador_restaurants
Thank you to the bartender Madison @jackknifepdx last night. After an exhausting conversation with someone about race and my being a gay man of color, Madison slipped me this note on my way out. It goes to show that no matter how opposed someone may be of your views, that you must still remain respectful and with dignity, because people are watching and listening and your words and how you portray yourself still have an affect on others around you. #jackknifepdx #madison #neverletanyonetakeyourshinebaby
This is how color was meant to be seen. #puertovallarta #closeyoureyesandopenyourheart #ifoundlovewhereitwasntsupposedtobe

There comes a time in life where you have to find your path to greatness. And I think I just stumbled upon mine. #puertovallarta #lifeformeishere #expat #closeyoureyesandopenyourheart #icantimagineprivelageanymore
I take my street for granted. But we also take life for granted.
Well, after multiple delays and push backs from Alaska Airlines 😒 I made it back to Portland and the first thing I could think of, was grab Mexican food! #gordo #javierstacos #mexicanfood
Beauty hidden in the hills. #puertovallarta #localart
He said that he loads the cinder blocks onto his horse Chula everyday and together they make the steep and long hike up and back down the mountain. I did that hike today and was scared that I was going to fall back down. We didn't have much of a conversation cause of the language barrier and I didn't want to disturb him while he worked. But what I could gather is that he is strong and dedicated an honest hard laborer, and probably does not get paid nearly enough for what his job entails. To him it was probably just another day on the job. To me it was nothing but respect for 2 living souls that I could tell were exhausted but grateful to still be alive. #chula #puertovallarta #respect #closeyoureyesandopenyourheart
Puerto Vallarta has no chill and clearly did not come to play with you hoes! #puertovallarta #dontholdback #nochill

Their taking a month long vacation from their home in Madrid and traveling though Mexico up to Arizona and back. Definitely an awesome couple with amazing stories and big hearts! Love you boys! #puertovallarta #newfriends #closeyoureyesandopenyourheart
Met my brother from another Monday night when I checked into my hotel. Not only is he staying at the same hotel, but his room is directly across from mine, and randomly, we also share a huge affinity for @mariahcarey ! Needless to say, we spent the whole day on the beach listening to Mariah and now having dinner together, talking story and enjoying the beautiful Mexican culture. Making new friends, and immersing myself into a beautiful culture is everything that was on my list to do down here! #puertovallarta #moments #mariahcarey #brotherfromanothermother #lambily#lambforlife

Soup's up!
My Bologna has a first name!
2 weeks ago I was sitting on my balcony waiting for Chris to pick me up to go to Sauvie Island. I was having a glass of wine when I saw an old lady seemingly frustrated and upset as she was locked out of her car right in front of my apartment. So I went downstairs to help her. I couldn't get either of the doors unlocked with her broken keys either but when Chris showed up we used his AAA to get a locksmith out to unlock her door. She was so appreciative that we went out of our way to help her and wait with her in the hot sun. Today, this bottle of wine along with a heart felt note from the lady, who's name is Jan was sitting on my doorstep thanking us. It only takes minutes out of your day to help someone. Pay it forward!
Umm, does anyone else see the olive oil Dinosaur in my frying pan, or am I under medicated?
