Stay strong, be tough, that's what the preacher tell you
He never really felt you, so he can't even help you
Need a shoulder to lean on, somebody to cry to
It's like everything's gone, but I'm a survivor
Standing on stage in front of thousands (yeah)
Don't amount to me not having my father
That's real talk, I know a lot of y'all got 'em
But you need 'em way more when you gotta go without 'em
And I'm without 'em, but that's life, y'all
Sometimes you gotta learn to swim with no lifeguard 😫🥲🥲
Happy Easter 🐣
