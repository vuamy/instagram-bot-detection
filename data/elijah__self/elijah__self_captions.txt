fun day out for @pokemongoapp flock together event! also stopped by to see some snakes! and added a Pokémon plush for the couch
Happy birthday my love ❤️
A little late but happy earth day 🌎
Pokémon couch is growing slowly. Also family got together for Easter 🩷🩵
made some new Minecraft’s build. Gotten mvp a few times on siege and made some new recipes.
one year really flew by I’m so happy I was able to spend it with you ❤️
This past minute built a castle had to nice headshots that I couldn’t believe I pulled off and made crunchwraps (ignore the dishes)
Late Christmas post but it was good being able to get with the family this Christmas especially those who traveled from far to get here. Was good to catch up with good people and have good times.
2023 was a rollercoaster of a year. Upgraded from renting an apartment to a house. Found another goose bringing the total to 5. And ended the year in the best relationship I could ask for. Here’s to 2024
Was it even Christmas if you didn’t have a Michael Landon art party?
Merry Christmas! 🎄💚❤️
Holiday fun❤️🎄
you make it feel like christmas 🎄❤️

I recommend giving hell followed with us a read. 🏳️‍⚧️💜
Super cool waiting experience at a haunted house! Couldn’t take picture in actual haunted house for obvious reasons and the escape room was super fun and learned you probably need more than two people to solve riddles😂

Been out as a trans man for almost two years and what an adventure it has been. Unearthing who I really am and becoming my true self. Making friends who have gone through this process as support. It’s been great! So glad to be out and be me! 
Hair done by @hdhairfairy she did a great job my hair is super vibrant and looks awesome! Go check out her page for more! 
Glasses are from spirit Halloween and they are my favorite accessory now!

Happy birthday to my best friend/sister not literally but literally. To the one whose been there since day one literally like toddlers. The one who encourages me to be me. The one who learned elvish just so we could write notes to each other in secret in 5th grade. We’ve been there for each thought thick and thin. You inspire me so much! Thanks for being amazing! Happy birthday love you! 

P.S I’m not sorry for the throwbacks they are amazing.❤️

Yesterday my best friend of forever had to leave me up here in Missouri. We spent our last few hours together until thanksgiving by sleeping, watching horror games on YouTube, and eating food. But I wouldn’t change those memories for anything. Almost 18 years now I’ve going to her house to talk to about our latest relationship drama. Spending hours on end playing Minecraft with each other building our be coolest houses ever. Doing a photoshoots every day to be able to make Instagram posts for like forever. It’s gonna be weird not being able to see her for a while. Imma miss you bitch. 😭
Happy national dog day! Got pooches from mine to pups at the dog parks
