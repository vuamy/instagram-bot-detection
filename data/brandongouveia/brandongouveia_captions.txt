A taste of summer with @brandongouveia Vibrant Grilled Pineapple Chimichurri Chicken. It’s simply delicious and full of fresh flavors. Full recipe below!

Grilled Pineapple Chimichurri Chicken

Ingredients
Chicken:
2 lb chicken thighs, skin on and deboned
¼ cup olive oil
2 teaspoons chicken bouillon
½ tablespoon smoked paprika
½ tablespoon garlic powder
½ tablespoon dried oregano
½ teaspoon sea salt
½ teaspoon black pepper
¼ teaspoon turmeric
¼ teaspoon cumin
Pineapple Chimichurri:
½ pineapple
1 cup olive oil
½ cup red wine vinegar
½ cup chopped parsley
½ cup chopped cilantro
5 garlic cloves, minced
1 red chile pepper, minced

Instructions
1. Prepare the chicken: In a large bowl, add the chicken thighs, olive oil, bouillon, paprika, garlic powder, oregano, sea salt, black pepper, turmeric, and cumin. Mix until evenly coated. Let marinate at room temperature for at least 30 minutes, or refrigerate to marinate for longer.
2. Preheat the grill to 375°F (190°C) and oil the grates.
3. Place the chicken thighs, skin-side down, on the prepared grates and cook for about 6 minutes, then flip. Continue cooking for an additional 6 minutes, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the chicken reads 165°F (73°C). I usually pull mine at 160°F (71°C) and let the carryover cooking finish it.
4. While the chicken thighs cook, prepare the chimichurri: Place the ½ pineapple for the chimichurri on the grill, flipping every few minutes. Pull when charred on both sides, about 10 minutes, then dice. In a medium bowl, mix together the diced pineapple, olive oil, vinegar, parsley, cilantro, garlic, and chile pepper in a medium bowl until well combined.
5. Remove the chicken from the grill and place on a plate.
6. Spoon the chimichurri on top of the juicy grilled chicken thighs, and enjoy!

French fries are cool but let’s make some delicious crispy oven baked hasselback potatoes with a Fresh Basil & Cilantro gremolata. These are a bit more show stopping than your average potato! Full recipe below  👇🏾 
#hasslebackpotatoes #crispy #gremolata 
Ingredients 
For Potatoes 
1lb. Yellow Baby Potatoes 
1 tablespoon Smoked paprika
1 tablespoon Garlic powder
Pinch of Maldon salt 
½ teaspoon Cayenne pepper 
Black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon Dried oregano

Basil & Cilantro gremolata
1 lime juice
2 garlic cloves
1 cup fresh cilantro
1 cup fresh basil
Salt to taste 
Pinch of chili flakes 
¼ cup olive oil 

Instructions 
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Wash your potatoes and pat them dry. 2. Use a sharp kitchen knife to cut each potato into slices about 1/4-inch apart. Make sure you don’t cut all the way down to the bottom. I find the best way to do this is to use 2 chop sticks as seen in the video, to prevent you from cutting all the way through.  3. Once all of your potatoes are sliced, place them in a bowl and evenly toss with oil and spices then a baking tray. Make sure the potatoes are all facing cut-side up before baking for at least 40 minutes. The potatoes will be crispy on the outside and soft on the inside when they are done. 4. Serve hot with gremolata and Enjoy!  

For Gremolata
1. Add chopped cilantro, basil, garlic, lime juice, olive oil, chili flakes, and salt in a small bowl and mix well. Taste. Add more lime to your liking or chili flakes for more heat.

Hey Friends wishing you all a Happy holiday! Took an unexpected break on here. I’m definitely looking forward to 2022🙏🏾. Wanted to share my Iced Lemon bundt cake recipe that I made for a holiday party it was a hit! Tiktok saw it first 🤫 

Be safe out here & Wishing you all a blessed and Happy New Year 🎉 🥂 

Iced Lemon Bundt cake 
4 cups all-purpose flour 3 teaspoon baking powder 2 box instant lemon pudding (3.4 ounce)  1 ½  teaspoon kosher salt 3 ¼  cup granulated sugar 6 large eggs - room temp. 1 cup vegetable oil 2 cup sour cream - room temp. zest of 3 lemons lemon juice, from zested lemons 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 
1 lemon for zesting  on top of cake!   Lemon glaze:  2 cups powdered sugar 10 tbsp lemon juice or more as needed  
Instructions:  
-Preheat the oven to 325°F. Grease a 12 cup bundt pan. I used a Nordic ware brand.
-In a large bowl,add baking powder,flour, pudding, salt, and whisk together then set aside. 
-In another bowl, using a hand mixer or whisk, mix together eggs, and sugar. Then add in sour cream,oil,  lemon zest ,lemon juice, and extract. Fully combined all ingredients.
-Sift in dry ingredients into the wet mixture and mix in until all dry ingredients are incorporated using a rubber spatula and pour batter into the prepared bundt pan. Gently tap the bundt pan on the counter to make sure the batter is even in the pan. Note: I had a little extra batter left over after filling the pan. 
-Bake for about an hour or until a toothpick inserted in the middle of the cake comes out clean. Allow the cake to cool for at least 15 minutes before turning the cake over onto a plate or cake stand.
-While the cake is cooling, whisk powdered sugar and lemon juice, using more or less lemon juice as needed to get a consistency you prefer.  I like to keep it slightly thick. Once the cake has cooled down, drizzle the glaze over the warm cake for some more lemon flavor feel free to zest more lemon zest on top of the glaze and enjoy!!
