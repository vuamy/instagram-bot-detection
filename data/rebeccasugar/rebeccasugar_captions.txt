This lost Steven Universe song may have been the reason the show was made! Along with the pilot, I pitched this scene from from a never-produced storyboard (the “shield board”) just before we got picked up. I never recorded a demo, and couldn’t remember the song until I recently found the thumbnails with the lyrics written out and the tune came back to me! ⭐️

@emilywalusart made us these masks
I’m auctioning my ukulele for @nationalbailout !!! I got this uke at the start of the show (look at these ancient pics!!!) & it’s been with me through thick and thin! I wrote the theme song on this! Go to @cartoonnetworkofficial for details!!!⁣
⁣
We’ve already raised over 20k from the stream— THANK YOU!!! Donations are STILL going!! LINK IN BIO (it works now!!!!!!) Aiming for 50k by the end of the night! CN will match! This is going toward freeing people who can not afford bail. ⁣
⁣
Remember: those who are up for bail have been arrested but NOT convicted of a crime! Today that includes peaceful protesters fighting for justice and a better future for their families! Black individuals are arrested at higher rates and given higher bail- they are being held in cages only because they can not afford bail. They have NOT been convicted of a crime. Why is it a wealthy person in the same situation can walk free?⁣
⁣
@nationalbailout & your donations are doing the work that must be done until we end this unbelievable injustice! ⁣
⁣
Donations are STILL going into the night!! If we hit 50k I will record the full version of the Change Your Mind song! THANK YOU!!! #freeblackmamas #nationalbailout #stevenuniverse #charityevent
Please check out this stream tomorrow! We’re raising money for @nationalbailout and CN will match up to 50,000! If we make it to 50k I’ll play the full version of the Change Your Mind song! I’ve never shared it! Please watch & donate, thank you so much!!!

Bisexual, Bi
A person who has the capacity to form enduring physical, romantic and/or emotional attractions to those of the same gender or to those of another gender. People may experience this attraction in differing ways and degrees over their lifetime. Bisexual people need not have had specific sexual experiences to be bisexual; in fact, they need not have had any sexual experience at all to identify as bisexual. -GLAAD Media Reference Guide 
Happy Bi Visibility Day 💙💜💖

A sketch tonight, listening to Eddie Lang, A little love, a little kiss.
Sketch for an unfinished comic, Margo in Bed. Found it in a binder... from 2010 I think
For paper I used to use plain old computer paper, 8.5x11! Nothing wrong with nice paper but it puts me on edge! I also love drawing on trash. Paper bags, cardboard, etc. I still do this... the lyrics for love like you I figured out on an envelope.
I recommend binders! Sketchbooks always made me nervous, and I would tear out pages, so I started using binders. I would draw a lot and throw most away, and save only what I liked, in sheet protectors. No pressure to get anything right on the first try. I would also print and keep reference and inspiration in there too. I would always have one of these with me! These 5 have drawings/comics from when I was 14-22.
@estelledarlings introduced me to Emily King's music a bit ago - just saw her live - so amazing
